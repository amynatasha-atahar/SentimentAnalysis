1,"Cheap, efficient but have safety issues","Air Asia is cheap and efficient, but with very limited leg room for taller people. <br /><br />But I don&#39;t think they have thought very carefully about the safety issues related to their Hot Seat policy. Because so called hot seats, which include all the front rows and the emergency exit rows are more expensive, they are often empty. I&#39;ve been on flights with nobody in the exit rows (and even worse, the staff sometimes put the tray tables down during the flight to prevent people sitting in the emergency seats... In an emergency that would delay anyone getting to the exit). In any emergency the fact that no-one is there to open the emergency door quickly means there would be a serious delay (every second counts!) to getting out of the plane if you sit near the middle of the plane. <br /><br />Also, I&#39;ve often seen people who would obviously be incapable of opening the emergency doors, which need to also be picked up and thrown out in the event of an emergency. A friend of mine who is 82 was sitting in one on one flight. But no Air Asia staff have the courage to do what is right and ask such people to move. <br /><br />The international safety regulators should look into this! <br /><br />Instead of leaving empty, why not just upgrade suitable people who pay for other seats and offer them an emergency exit seat. That would help ensure quick opening of exits in an emergency. <br /><br />I wonder if there was anyone in those emergency exit seats when the Air Asia flight crashed in Indonesia. In that case it probably wouldn&#39;t have made a difference, but in other cases it might!  <br /><br />Finally, AirAsia is still using plastic cutlery in an age of awareness over Single-use plastic. Why can&#39;t they have reusable utensils...."
1,Beware!!! Mistake or Scam???,"We were refused Boarding due to an Air Asia Ticketing Error. We attempted to contact Air Asia Customer Support to get it rectified. Despite being a Air Asia BIG Loyalty Program Member for more than 5 years we were unable to get it rectified. This was Air Asia&#39;s mistake but they deny liability. Repeated attempts to get Customer Support were useless. You cannot speak with anyone. Are forced to use Automated Response that is ineffective, confusing and frustrating. If you do manage to get to their &quot;Allstars&quot; chat program (communicating by texting ... not voice) then the staff are unhelpful, combative and sometimes rude. Come on Air Asia get your act together. Your Guest Details Booking Page needs to be updated to reflect current Ticketing Requirements, Your Customer Support Systems need a total overhaul and your support staff need to be educated that unless they take care of customers then they won&#39;t have a job. I am now wondering exactly how many other people have had this experience. It must be highly profitable to be paid money for flights and then not have to fly people.<br />After 5 years of flying Air Asia I, and my entire family, are now having to warn people of this situation .... Shame Air Asia!!!"
1,Aweful. Totally disappointed.,Aweful. I am totally disappointed. Worse than nothing. Waste of money. Useless personal will try to do everything so that you have problems and nothing for help.
5,I would book with them again,"I am very happy with the service of AirAsia. Charles Robert C. Bulilan was unbelievably quick, professional and kind moving me to an earlier flight."
1,"NO HELP, BOOKING CANCELLED WITHOUT REFUND","NO HELP, BOOKING CANCELLED WITHOUT REFUND<br />I had a terrible experience with lastminute.com when I wanted to change the dates of my flight. Neither the lastminute.com nor the airline felt responsible or was able to help me. I talked to in total 8 representatives with just being referred from one side to the other. I never learned if it was theoretically possible to change the dates against a fee (which it should be), but CANCELLED the ticket with NO REFUND.<br /><br />I initially contacted lastminute.com to change the date and was then referred to the airline (Thai AirAsia) itself as lastminute couldn&#39;t help me. After talking to 3 different airline customer representatives, they all told me that only lastminute can change the dates. I went back to lastminute and told me that it was the airline. The airline again told me that it was lastminute...you get the idea. No help, just blaming the other side.<br />I would have been fine if someone would have told me that I can&#39;t change the booking, but instead I was trapped in this hamster wheel without getting ANY ANSWER."
1,If you really care your customer then&#8230;,"If you really care your customer then listen my concern and solve it if you really care your customer, hope every cx here is waiting for a reply here.<br />My flight got cancelled on 7th November with PNR: H4RJ6H Flight no:I5715 which was from Pune- Srinager. I got board from pune, as soon as we reahed Delhi,the Airaisa officials announced that the flight will get delay by 1 hour because of bad weather in srinager. After 1 hour new announcement came that the flight got cancelled. When we raised our concern to Airaisa manager at Delhi airport that why you people cancelled the flight, why you didn&#39;t wait for 1 more hour? He was speechless and told that the announcement is from higher officials.<br />Funny part is when approached to cx care they said we can process you only 1000 rs refund while as ticket price was 4676 rs, got was transferred to Manager and manager was not having answer for and she simply disconnect the call.<br /><br />i wish more and more people will read the comment and will be alart if the flight gets cancelled dont let the manager go, fight for arranging the new flight or get the refund on the spot, don&#39;t let them go as they are big fraudesters and it is a scam of airlines nowadays to cancel the flights and initiate little amount."
1,Aisasia worst airlines,Aisasia is one of the worst airlines with extremely bad temper ugly manner Malays who treats customers like rubbish. The airlines have black face Malay who  lack basic manners. The airlines staff would bark at you and shout at you especially if you are Asian. Avoid this low class airlines at all cost
1,RUDE &amp; UNPROFESSIONAL STAFFS IN BINTULU&#8230;,"RUDE &amp; UNPROFESSIONAL STAFFS IN BINTULU AIRPORT (Silo &amp; Nomi) <br />Used &#8220;F&#8221; word during the conversation with customer. <br />When wanted to lodge a complaint, <br />Was told &#8220;go ahead &amp; lodge the complaint it is very normal to us&#8221; by the staffs <br />No patience &amp; inexperienced in handling customer&#8217;s issues. LOW EQ. <br />No apologies to customer. <br />No proper channel to address customer&#8217;s issues. <br /><br />Been a loyal customer, however this kind of staff&#8217;s manner is intolerable. &amp; proper action should be taken. <br />THE BEST LOW COST AIRLINE IN THE WORLD IS A JOKE. Proven to be LOW QUALITY as well. <br /><br />Management is a total failure, <br />After 10 years no improvement made for customer service, compared to other airlines, Airasia is only getting worse. Very disappointing."

1,THE WORST!!!,"THE WORST!!!<br /><br />I flew twice with them and twice Non Dangerous Goods have been removed out of my main luggage. Goods with sentimental value. <br /><br />On top of that - Ground Staff have been terrible and even bullied me into booking another flight.<br /><br />Never in my entire life would I have thought, this is a thing! &#128545;"
5,Bought ticket to Thailand few days ago,Bought ticket to Thailand few days ago. The service is great I mean like I don&#39;t even have to wait. I bought online though maybe my Internet connection is really great. Some people said the site is always down. The price is really cheap. I can&#39;t wait to buy again the ticket online to celebrate New Year.

3,The worst possible booking experience&#8230; with a positive outcome.,"Update (14.11.2019):<br />After a long odyssey, we were actually able to get a good solution with AirAsia. This was an extremely cumbersome process, but I want to acknowledge the fact that they ended up supporting us. Also the overall transportation was well organised and got us to our destination. Thanks for that! <br /><br />Original post: <br />The worst possible booking experience and even worse customer service. Booked a connection and got a different one confirmed. Attempted several times to get in touch with customer service through the &quot;allstar service&quot;. Connection is being deliberately interrupted, the problem is being neglected even though it is reproducible. It is so frustrating to waste so much time with this when you&#39;re traveling. Recommend to avoid them whenever possible!<br />One star is probably already too much..."
1,How NOT to go from Sihanoukville to Singapore,"My biggest complaint about this company is their lack of integrity.  I tried to change a flight date. Something they say you can do , as long as it is NOT within 2days of departure. Those are reasonable terms. 12days before my flight I attempted to change my date of departure. (Vacation gone wrong). I was unable to find a way of making contact by phone, so I used their &#8220;online assistant&#8221; Ava.<br />The response was that I was not allowed to change my destination, when all I wanted to do was change the date..... and this was before I even entered my confirmation code???   Obviously they had &#8220; glitches&#8221; in this program, so after 3 attempts, and with our time running short, we elected to just go to the airport to sort things out.  <br />    The customer service person at the airport (very nice person, by the way) assured us we could change the flights. All we had to do was, wait three days for the next available flight, and pay an additional $540 USD on a flight for which we had paid only $230 USD!<br />   To make a long complaint short, we took a 5 hr taxi ride to the next airport and caught an Air Asia flight to Kuala Lumpur, where our connection flight to Singapore was to depart from.    Not possible. No credit. No flight. Nothing.    (They WOULD refund our airport tax.)<br />Buy new ticket was the best option they could provide.     My suggestion is fly with another airline, unless you are 100% sure your plans are not going to change.  PS This was the first airline I ever flown ( I&#8217;m now 67) that did not even provide a drink of water. (You could pre-order food and drink.)."
1,Ripped me off,"Ripped me off wose then I have ever been in my life. I paid for baggage online then they said i didnt so i had to pay 5x the price at the airport and ended up charging me $414 usd for 2 average sized bags for a 4 hour flight, which is more than double what i paid for the flight. No custmer service, no help. They have extorted me and I will be going out of my way to tell everyone how bad they are"
1,I would rather give them zero,"I would rather give them zero. This company doesn&#8217;t respect customers at all. They changed flight schedule, which is agreeable according to contract but I have not been refunded for 3 months since then. They should be cash rich company since they don&#8217;t give you proper refund. Be aware of AirAsia and I will never use it."
1,My husband and I got our boarding&#8230;,"My husband and I got our boarding passes in PEN for flight to KUL and PER on flight AK 6129 on 15 October 2019 and, D7236 to Perth. We had only one 20kg check in luggage all the way to Perth. Our boarding pass show Gate no 5 so we waited close to the departure gate. Our boarding time is 20.35. We waited for approximately an hour when we realised that our flight is already due for boarding. We quickly approached one ground staff and was told that the Gate has been moved to Gate no 7 . We rushed to Gate no 7 and was told that the aircraft doors are closed and they cannot re open the door.They have make the necessary announcement and we have missed the flight. Our check in luggage has been offloaded.<br />We asked them why there is no notification or why they didn&#39;t send a representative to the original gate to notify us. They said that all announcement were made but since it was so noisy and the announcement was so muffled we didn&#39;t hear it. They were not helpful and didn&#39;t care to have anything to do with us.We were left on our own to find a new flight back to Perth.<br />I believe AirAsia is responsible for the negligence to inform us of the change and I hope this will not happen again to other fellow passengers booking with AirAsia."
1,Worst airline ever.,Airline change destination to kertajati after purchased tickets. I have to pay idr300000 extra for bus tickets. And has to travel another 3 hours on each way. No any compansation. They offer refund which will show up on my card after 1-3 months. Have to avoid this nightmare airline.
1,Cheats,"Absolutely terrible customer service!<br /><br />I booked through Expedia and was told at the last minute that my outward flight had been booked, but the return hadn&#39;t.  This necessitated a call to the AirAsia.  I had to get the number from Expedia.  I was told by Expedia that AirAsia have MANY different numbers most of which do not work.  I waited on hold for over thirty minutes.  Nothing.  I tried this for several days before calling Expedia who were able to sort the problem.  <br /><br />I had to cancel my flight for personal reasons but could NEVER reach or contact AirAsia.  Expedia advised me just to leave it.  <br /><br />The company is a sham.  Avoid AirAsia AT ALL COSTS!"
1,The worst cabin crew ever met,"Hello.<br />I travel each week because of my job. Many flights a year. This time, I took with wife that plane for holidays. Means we were cool and stress less.<br />Just one thing about this company : that is the worst cabin crew I have ever met (and I travel a lot with Ryanair ;))<br />They wake you up for nothing, check your boarding pass on the middle of the flight (...) don&#8217;t speak kindly to you but very badly, etc.<br />Will choose Malindo airlines next time ! Never again with them."
1,The worst airline for sure,The worst airline for sure. With lowest costumer service and rudest stuffs. I strongly recommend ignore this airline.
1,Heights of delaying,"Hi<br />I&#39;m karishma patel. I ama fashion designer. I am first time travelling in airasia flight, which is kept delaying since Morning 8:55am to 12:55 . Also if they have some technical issues in flight, they can&#39;t not &#10060; serve you anything to drink and eat which is making travelers more freak.also after asking them many times these people kept saying ma&#39;am we don&#39;t know howong is it going to take and we can&#39;t provide you beverages if we do to you, other people will also expect the same. I don&#39;t know how it was stuff task to provide someone food  in such emergency when you kept us waiting 5hours.I personally would never advice any body to book this company again. Where a client is not treated with such professionally and in Unrespectful. Please never think of booking airasia. Also I want my money to be refunded."
3,i like flying with them and the prices&#8230;,i like flying with them and the prices are great. but the website and mobile app are totally bugged out. this is going on for years now. very sad to see that there is no improvement. time to exchange your cto or product manager and get a proper development team guys
1,Airasia is just lie,Airasia is just lie they advertise trip to Lombok <br />Example $150.00 AUD yet when you to book <br />Is over $1000.00 AUD  I can go to Europe for that <br />Plus airasia took the route Australia to Lombok <br />For some amount of subsidy from the Lombok government to bring more tourist.because the local businesses and residents are struggling <br />But what airasia is doing? Nothing  <br />They try to compare them self to Jetstar <br />When Jetstar was on Perth Lombok route <br />It was great for local business the residents and the travelers <br />On top of that try to call customer service no one pick up the phone <br />I was looking going to Lombok they advertise $130 when you to book is $555.44 one way <br />Lies Lies
1,Extremely worst flight that I have ever&#8230;,Extremely worst flight that I have ever  booked ticket on airline.
1,Cheap but you have to be patient,Horrible. Still waiting for my refund. Ava is poor feature. Website payment system doesn&#39;t work properly.
1,Absolutely untrustworthy,Absolutely untrustworthy<br />This company should be avoided!<br />Since July 2018 we are waiting for refund number WQE73D and GP132T. I assume that all positive references are bought from the PR department. A shame for the CEO and the headquarters in Malaysia. It&#39;s a shame for Malaysia to host this pirate gang.
1,Customer service staff in Manila makes&#8230;,Customer service staff in Manila makes up their own rules. Surprisingly customer service lied to me about rules of hand luggage and blamed Manila Airport rules but when I ask security they told me it is the airline who makes that up to charge customers extra. Cheap for sure and the ground staff shows the same. Cheap untrained staff who cashes up customers.<br />Shame on you air Asia Philippines. <br /><br />Disgusted by your customer service
2,Passenger unfriendly airline,"Flights are punctual, and aircraft are clean. Fares are often a bit lower than other airlines. However, I&#39;m still an unhappy traveller on AirAsia. They have a very unfriendly policy towards seat assignment at the counter - they do not accommodate any preferences even if seats are available, UNLESS YOU PAY. They also harass passengers about baggage weight. After a thorough check at the checkin, they ask passengers to weigh luggage again near the gate! They&#39;re looking for every opportunity to squeeze more money out of passengers! Awful attitude."
1,Consistently awful. Every single time.,"Simply the worst airline in the world, many years running. I&#8217;ve been unfortunate enough to have to rely on this sorry excuse for an airline for years and not once, NOT ONCE, have I ever had a good experience. Not a single flight that went smoothly, with no delay or some other nonsense. Awful service, always late, anything to take your money and always unpleasant. The only thing they haven&#8217;t charged us for yet is oxygen on board, which at some point it will probably be charged also, 10cents per breath. If only there were other options for certain destinations... Today&#8217;s misfortune: retiming of flight the day before, only to come to airport, go to gate as indicated and find out there (i.e. at the gate) that there would be another delay on top of a change in gates. Still waiting to board, holiday ruined. Avoid this airline if you can. Pay more, get better service somewhere else."
5,Flown with them loads,"Flown with them loads. Great airline, always on time. Very happy!"
2,Just so so,Our flight was delayed but the pilot no the attendants wont even announce the reason. We waited for almost an hour before we took off.
1,This is the worst airline I&#39;ve ever&#8230;,This is the worst airline I&#39;ve ever used. Im supposed to leave from Iloilo to manila where I have a connecting flight going to Europe. I&#39;ve now waited more than 3 hours and I dont think i can make my connecting flight from Manila. I expected some delay as I&#39;m in the Philippines and people apparently don&#39;t know what time is here. I&#39;ve never experienced this kind of service from a European airline.
1,7kg carry on &quot;to speed up boarding&quot;. Total BS and the opposite happens,"Firstly, 7kg carry on limit makes no sense. I absolutely understand the need to have smaller bags on board and I&#39;m happy with that. However, 7kg limit is terrible. With my camera and commuter stuff that&#39;s already nearly 7kg. It doesn&#39;t make sense that I can&#39;t take more. I&#39;ve flown all around the world and it&#39;s my first time seeing this. it&#39;s a terrible system. <br /><br />What&#39;s worse is that the company makes airport personnel charge people absolutely ridiculous fees to check in bag. I had a total of 14kg with two small bags. The staff made me check in my bag and charged me nearly 90USD &quot;for 0-15kg over weight&quot;. I understand things happen, even that you have a 7kg terrible policy, but making customers pay exuberant fees for things like this is a terrible experience. <br /><br />To top it all off, the staff lost my bags&#39; special cover during transit and took no responsibility for it. They said &quot;yea, that&#39;s not covered by us...&quot; I will not fly AirAsia for these reasons. I am happy to tell all my friends and fans to boycott the company. A business simply can&#39;t run like this."
1,I was overcharged and have tried to&#8230;,"I was overcharged and have tried to raise a complaint thru their website but to no avail. Their customers service is so bad it is unbelievable. They are totally unhelpful and keep closing the case before it is resolved. I have had to open 7 separate cases and they still will not address the issue, they just send an unhelpful generic email and close the case.<br />They do not even try to help you....<br />Does anybody know how to elevate a complaint or know of any other way of making a complaint other than thru their website. The website complaint section is a complete waste of time"
1,Request refund due to flight&#8230;,"Request refund due to flight reschedule. Air asia processed for a month and then told us that the case is submitted to the bank. But when I call bank, bank said did not receive the money. Meanwhile, the case status at airasia said as &quot;closed&quot;."
1,Short version,"Short version: AirAsia rebooked our flights giving us 55 minutes to make an international connection in Kuala Lumpur. We tried several times to change this, but mind bogglingly, were told that 55 minutes was enough time to make an international connection. We were told the only other option was to rebook at our own expense. This was approximately US$600 per person to move a short domestic flight by a few hours. Since they wouldn&#8217;t move us, we bought a standalone ticket to Kuala Lumpur at a fraction of the price, but were then told we couldn&#8217;t use it otherwise they would cancel our connecting international flight. Even though we had bought a new ticket and had seats saved on the earlier flight, apparently they STILL couldn&#8217;t do anything. To top it off, they would only refund the airport taxes/fees for these tickets. Surprisingly, 55 minutes is NOT enough time to reasonably make an international connection&#8230;who would have guessed? My wife (who has arthritis in her knees) and I ended up running the entire way (about 1.5km), and made the flight by about one minute. She is still having trouble with her knees because of this weeks later. AirAsia is absolutely awful, and I would strongly discourage anyone from flying with them.<br />The AirAsia flight rebooking policy is an absolute travesty, and borderline dangerous. We initially booked an international flight with a 1 hour 35 minute layover/connection in Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia changed this flight so we only had 55 minutes to make an international connection...obviously not enough time. When we first tried to change this flight (in person) the customer service rep said she would do so, and we would get confirmation via email in a day or two. Instead, we got confirmation of the same flights, with no further explanation. I then contacted AirAsia via their online chat (which is horrible) and was told that it was against their policy to change the flights if the change in flight time is less than 45 minutes. They conveniently moved the flight by 40 minutes, just shy of the rebooking mark, so they wouldn&#8217;t rebook us. They also told us we shouldn&#8217;t worry about it, 55 minutes was plenty of time to make an international connection. We were told if we wanted to change the short domestic flight, we&#8217;d have to go through the booking change process and pay the normal fee, which ended up being about US$600 per person&#8230;to change a 1hr domestic flight to one a few hours earlier.<br />The next flight out if we missed our connection was 24 hours later, meaning we&#8217;d miss our day in Australia, lose our hotel booking, probably go without bags, and quite possibly miss or next connecting international flight as well. Rather than risk all this (which AirAsia seemed to think was acceptable, just as long as they didn&#8217;t have to move our flight a few hours) I decided to book earlier standalone domestic tickets to Kuala Lumpur instead. Lo and behold, when we get to the airport to check in, we are told that we can&#8217;t use the new tickets to Kuala Lumpur, otherwise they will cancel our entire international trip as &#8220;no shows&#8221;. The counter staff agreed that 55 minutes wasn&#8217;t enough time, but apparently, they were forbidden from changing the flights as well. This is despite us already having space on the earlier flight due to the new tickets we bought. To add insult to injury, they wouldn&#8217;t refund us for the new tickets, except for the airport tax portion. And on top of that, after sitting around at the airport for many hours waiting for our flight, the check in person chastises us for booking a flight with such a tight connection! Absolutely unbelievable.<br />So we ended up sticking with the original tickets, rather than have AirAsia cancel our entire flight. Luckily, our domestic flight was on time, as we ended up running the entire 1.5km between the terminals, only to hear last call for our flight when we were still several gates away. We ended up making our international flight by about 1 minute. My wife has arthritis in her knees, and weeks later, she is still having constant problems due to running top speed through the airport with our luggage. Depending on what the doctor has to say about my wife&#8217;s knees, we may be back in touch regarding any legal liability. If anything whatsoever would have gone wrong at security, immigration, disembarking, or anything else, we would have missed the flight. All of this, and risking tons of issues if we missed our international flight, for&#8230;not entirely sure what rationale they have, really.<br />Actual people, who can actually do anything, are basically impossible to get ahold of as well. AirAsia is absolutely awful, and I will be strongly discouraging anyone from flying with them. Thanks very much, AirAsia."
1,Worse experienced with Air Asia shore staffs,"My flight delayed and I approached service counter at Macau. They issue meal coupon but I declined. I requested to go back home to wait and return before 19:40pm at the boarding gate. <br />The lady informing me my connecting flight is KL -Pen at 5:25. Then without informing they need to re-issue my ticket.<br />I boarding by my old ticket as usual. Then arrive transit immigration and scan my hand carry. And I reach J12 gate. The Malay gentleman ask me to go to Service Counter next to T16 which I actually not sure where is it. <br />Then I walk till the shop of Victoria Secret and met a tall skinny AK staff, Malay guy. I explained my matter. He ask me to go out from international exit and go 1 floor up to Service Counter next to T16. I told him I cannot out as my flight is connecting. My baggage will direct to Penang. He still insist. <br />I arrived Service Counter next to T16. The Malay guy ask me go back to pick up my luggage otherwise he will not issue me a new ticket. <br />Then I go back and meet the police woman Haxxxx and another Chinese AK staff with glasses. They not allow me to go in to pick up my luggage as he said mine is connecting flight. He insisted I m check out from international flight by immigration so that I m now outside domestic hall. Which I m really confused. He told me my luggage for sure will not be there. Cause my flight is connecting flight.  They ask me back again to Service Counter next to T16. <br />Again I go to Service Counter next to T16. <br />Imagine my flight is a day before morning 10:45, and I reached airport at 0800. And arrived KL next day morning 4:00, and thought finally I can catch 5:25 flight. But I m stuck here until 8:25. <br />1. The gentleman at J12 gate shouldn&#8217;t direct me to service counter next to T16. I only get to know from the Chinese AK staff should re-issue at transfer counter.<br />2. Passenger who had bad experienced flight delayed never ask for any compensation but been leading and turning up side down from AK staffs. <br />3. I buying hot seat but re-issue with normal seat. <br />This is a disaster experience ever I had with Air Asia. <br /><br />Really bad!"
5,We had the worst experience with&#8230;AirAsia.,We had the worst experience with AirAsia. We arrived at the boarding gate just 5 mins late and we were denied boarding. We were carrying kids as well and the boarding gate was so far away as well. The front gate spent the whole time arguing with us and were very rude. The plane was still boarding luggage&#8217;s while we stood arguing with them. With other flights they make a call and assist passengers with children. Other flights were also waiting for passengers who were late but they stood arguing for 5 mins. The staff is very rude and do not co-operate.
1,Cancelled at short notice flight,"Cancelled at short notice flight, employing robots in the customer service without a sense of customer focused problem solving."
1,Terrible check in staff.,"The flight and airline were fine but the baggage drop/check in was a nightmare.  The young girl at the desk argued with me for 10 minutes about if I needed a visa to go to Vietnam (I didn&#39;t as it&#39;s visa on arrival).  I told her I was late and she still insisted on delaying me so I almost missed the flight. <br /><br />This wasn&#39;t an isolated incident as on the return flight from Ho Chi Min another young girl refused to give me my boarding pass as I &#39;didn&#39;t meet the visa requirements&#39; to go to Bangkok in Thailand.  She held the boarding pass under the desk and told me to come back in half an hour.  She eventually only handed it to me I produced my forward flight.<br /><br />As an experienced traveler this was certainly the worst experience I have had with any airline.  In recent years the check in girls and boys have been encouraged to do the &#39;donkey&#39; work of immigration and they are very unsuited to the task being often very unsure of what they&#39;re doing.  Generally very poor from Air Asia.  I will avoid flying with them again.<br /><br />As a note, the actually immigration staff... no problem, through in 2-5 minutes.  Later flew with Lufthansa and Egypt Air, both great, friendly staff, highly recommended.  Air Asia, no."
1,Would give 0 stars if I could....,"Would give 0 stars if I could....<br /><br />Booked my 50 minute flight to catch two connecting flights from Ilo Ilo to Manila and then to London<br /><br />My 50 minute flight was delayed by 1hr. No problem I thought, that&#39;s still two hours to catch my first correcting flight...<br /><br />But no, 1 hour turned into 3 hours and thus I missed both connecting flights. The best they could offer was a refund on the delayed flight., meaning I had to book two other flights from scratch costing over £400 plus hotel and food for the night and taxi to and from the airport<br /><br />Will never use Air Asia again. Very unhelpful and not willing to compensate when they should. No wonder this finish has such bad reviews, I will never use again"
3,Asia&#39;s biggest budget airlines website in continously updated with new traps to make you pay for things you never wanted.,"Asia&#39;s biggest budget airline with affiliates in several countries. You either love them or hate them. If you come with low expectations it works just fine. Routes with low frequency are prone for cancellations and sometimes their cancellations and subsequent refunds can make your blood boil. But having flown around 100 flights with them I can say it works, They are doing good in ads to hypnoses those in believing they are always the cheapest.<br /><br />Their website is continuously updated with traps that makes you pay for add on&#39;s you never wanted in the first place so you need to be very increasingly alert to catch up on these. Check the final price before paying (yes including processing fees) if it is still worth it."
1,The Worst staff,The Worst and most unsupportive airline. They charged me 1000 baht for 12.5 kgs of one bag that too when me and my husband were allowed 14 kgs.
1,"Dishonest, Very bad budget Airline in the world!","QZ269 -20 June 2019<br />my flight to Jakarta was delayed 2 times! AirAsia sent me and email saying that i have an option to get a refund. And when I follow the steps as stated in the email to request for refund from their website, there&#39;s no refund option! you see, when u send out emails telling your customers there&#39;s refund option, make sure you are willing to refund your customers without letting them wait soooooo long! There&#39;s only a few countries numbers that I can call which none is from my country singapore. There&#39;s no email address. There&#39;s only a livebot, which is useless as it only has standard answers. I wrote a complain and they only say they will send to relevant department to handle. DO they even have people working back end in the first place? I will never take airasia ever again! They are making themselves look like a low budget that cheats money airline! Hope this airline wont last long!"
1,The worst airline ever,"The worst airline ever. My flight to osaka is a disaster. First of all, my BOUGHT seat is randomly assign after i CHECKED IN. My party is scattered to different place. What is the use of value pack and the BOUGHT SEAT when you are still randomly assign when you have PAID FOR IT? S**t value pack with s**t meal. And when i return? My BOUGHT SEAT is also randomly ASSIGN after i checked in. Secondly, we are a party of 7+1 kid and has 7 luggage to checked in. 5 Adult has checked in first with all their luggage and has taken their boarding pass. While me and my kid is last to check in(of course is still within 2 hour before departure time), i got 3 luggage label. When boarding, my other party realised that they were not given any luggage label/sticker. We have asked the staff in the boarding gate, the staff checked from their PC with the status of 7 luggage total and combine into my label(they said). When in KL, i ask the transit counter staff to checked again if the luggage is 7. The staff in KL said yes, total 7 luggage. So, i assume we are safe. When i arrive in osaka late night which arrive 30 min earlier(which is useless due to a long drive to the terminal which made up the same as original ETA schedule). Everybody has taken their luggage and mine is missing one. All the airport staff has gone panic and try to find it. I got my luggage 3 days later. Thanks to air asia, i have no cloth for 3 days and i need to call yamato delivery for delivery due to uncertain delivery times(which cost me roaming charges too). And usually i did not buy any travel insurance, luckily i bought it this time. And to claim for my inconvenience? It is harder than winning a lottery. They don&#39;t even bother to apologize at all. thanks to the Osaka airport staff which is always helpful and very attentive."
1,Checked in baggage damaged,"Checked in baggage damaged whilst in the hold - a coloured oil got into my suitcase through the zip whilst checked in on the plane and damaged clothes and my suitcase - all of which have had to go in the bin. I am concerned about where this oil has come from, but Air Asia seem to have no worries at all and are expressing a disregard to passengers belongings in their care.<br />I have put through 3 requests to Air Asia about this, every single one has been closed whilst asking me to it through again! I have been told that I should have told Air Asia when I collected my suitacse from the baggage reclaim belt...but as the damage is internal I&#39;m struggling to see how I would have known to look - I would understand if my case was dented/scratched/missing a wheel but this is entirely different.<br />I am extremely disappointed, fly with another airline."
1,Worst airline experience ever!!,"Worst airline experience ever!!! Some of the staff very rude! No understandings for tall people! Wanted to sit on this red seat, that have more space for the legs but the staff became very rude and told me rudly that i cannot sit there and that i need to move right away. All read seats were empty btw. And then during the flight the staff went and seat there! HAHAHAHA But lets go back at beggining when we booked this trip. We went on their official site and book tickets to Cambodia. Nowhere during the booking was mentioned that we need to prebook our baggage and our meals so we thought everything is included like in every other NORMAL AIRLINE!!! We went on the airport and then we got a ,,PLEASENT&quot; suprise that we need to pay 80 dollars per bag?!?!?!?! And this was not mentioned during the booking! Ofc we have to do this because we didnt have a choise. Then on the board one more ,,PLEASENT&quot; suprise... We had to pay for our meals also. Its not expencive but again it wasn&#39;t nice feeling at all. Then on the way back same terrible service but this time they managed to break our both bags! ON PURPOSE! We had a locks on our bags and this ,,FINE GENTLEMANS&quot; BREAK??????? the lock so they can open the bags. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AND STAY AWAY FROM AIR ASIA! BETTER TO PAY 100-200$ MORE FOR OTHER AIRLINES THEN TO EXPERIENCE THIS. THANK YOU AND I HOPE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL READ THIS! o/ And one more thing. I do hope this airline will stop to exist!"
1,Very bad customer service,"Very bad customer service, no assistance. Avoid this scammer company or just take it when the prices are extra cheap. Disappointing and disgusting management."
5,Brilliant low cost airline.,"Here is a little light in what seems to be a sea of negativity. I have lived in Asia for the past 14 years and have literally flown with AirAsia between 60-80 times. That&#39;s a quick estimate.  I fly domestic and Bangkok to Cambodia , Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Vietnam and go home to Australia a couple of times a year. In all those trips I have never had a flight cancelled. I have had perhaps 8-10 delayed flights nothing excruciating, and two flight schedule changes. I appreciate the tools available for flight tracking your times and email notification. Domestic flights in Asia the seating is a bit tight, I am over 6 ft tall, but really an hour or so flight I can&#39;t complain.  International or long flights , I book an exit row and sleep all night. The prices are brilliant at times and good at other times. The flight crews are really fantastic hard working people. What else, they fly Airbus and that suits me just fine. No problems with the food it is what it is and better than other low cost airlines I have flown on,  and goodness me book and pay online and it is cheaper and tastier than any airport  fast food options. I am always on the lookout for promotional fares from all airlines , but I will never hesitate and will continue to choose to fly Airasia. It&#39;s a low cost airline. If you wish to choose full service great  enjoy. For me, I am flying Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City next week for a little over 3000 baht  , that around $100 folks. Brilliant low cost airline."
1,I would rather canoe over the Indian Ocean..,"WHEN YOU TELL SOMEONE THEY CAN GET A REFUND THAT MEANS MONEY BACK!! NOT A CREDIT. I have never been more disappointed with a company. My sister had a medical problem and the way she was treated was horrible. She still wanted to fly with you but your company is making it impossible. She booked tickets with her partner. After being in hospital her partner was unable to go on the trip as all of his leave was used whilst he was at the hospital. She asked me to go so she wasn&#8217;t on her own. You guys would not do a name change. Fine. Can we refund the tickets to rebook with my name, your team said yes. So then to save money we booked one day earlier as it was cheaper. The next day we ask for a refund on the original tickets to be told it&#8217;s actually a credit. Google the definition of a refund! So now we have two flights. Your terms are lies and I will be contacting the ACCC. I will be telling EVERYONE about the terrible service and how my poor sister was treated"
1,Worst,"Worst! I booked for a flight thru their app, didnt accepted my cards so i chose dragonpay, but when i funded my dragonpay it says &quot;amount is too big to be unverified&quot; i tried all the mode of payments but in the last step where you will slide something.. it will error.  I tried multiple times, the airfare price continually increased and i have not booked for my fare yet. WASTED MY TIME &#128078;&#127998;"
1,most  worst air service I ever&#8230;,"most  worst air service I ever experience till now is air Asia ,,those female helpers have so much ego as they hired us and the way they deal with lagguage quite disguise us about their services .i would recommend spice jet ,far better than air Asia .They don&#8217;t even offer water in flight even if you are dying until you ask ,implies they have no sense of duty.It should be preferred when somebody is going to hell only .Most disgusting service they have ."
1,I booked a flight with my wife last&#8230;,"I booked a flight with my wife last night leaving today at 11:25 am, these tickets were not the cheapest. They charged up for the more expensive tickets and then sent me the flight details for 10:25 pm arriving after midnight, I called as soon as I had cell service as I am in Thailand and they pretty much said you have to pay for an entire other ticket, the manager can not help and they can have the IT department look at the website in 7-10 days but too bad for you! I have a lot more flights to take and I will not fly Air Asia again as well as all the people who follow my blog will know what type of customer service they offer!"
1,Nothing good to say about this company,Nothing good to say about this company
1,Terrible customer service and dishonest website,"The options to contact customer service outside of Asia are rubbish. It&#39;s either through social media, where you hardly get a useful reply, or through some online chat which never connects. The main problem I have is when booking online, it preselects various options for you, and if your not careful, you end up getting tricked into paying extra for some service you don&#39;t need, in my case double the amount of extra luggage. When I asked if they could take the 2 lots of extra luggage we had been duped into taking and using it on our return flight, it was just a plain no. Useless customer service, how hard is it to go onto a computer and cancel my 2 kids extra luggage and transfer it to me and my wife&#39;s return flight. It feels like they are basically stealing from you. Unprofessional, terrible customer service and a website that is dishonest. I&#39;ll never give them my business again"
2,Long gone the days I used to like&#8230;,"Long gone the days I used to like AirAsia, I ve been flying with them from the very early days. Here s why my rating so low:<br /><br />1- booking process: poor and unclear<br />2-AVA please take down this useless thing<br />3-Hidden charges when booking abound and I have seen charges added without me selecting them. (i.e seat choice)<br />4-Seats, getting narrower and narrower<br />5-At the airport more often than not many ATMs are down and rarely all working, leading to time loss<br /><br />Unless sorted, I think AirAsia will continue bleeding customers."
1,watch the terms and condition if you&#8230;,watch the terms and condition if you get a credit. impossible to arrange a new flight.
5,5 stars for the price,5 stars for the price. Everything else sucks.
1,Budget airline,"Budget airline. Booked premium flatbed. No dedicated check in and no priority boarding as promised when paying extra. Also no Air Asia big loyalty points except from Malaysian ports. Told by customer service should be credited, wait 3 weeks for it to occur. Does not occur, told IT issues and backlog, wait another 4 weeks, still no points, told will definitely fix problem and wait another 4 weeks. Still no correction. Then told it is now more than 3 months since flights and can no longer be corrected. No one takes responsibility and customer service will just give you the run around till they can quote a loophole in their policies. Also cannot directly speak with anyone except social media and then you are ignored. Service in flight also minimal even in premium flatbed, flights delayed but bed does lie flat and more comfortable than in economy but not sure worth it with all the bad service."
4,thanks&#8230;to the ground stuff of Air Asia Makassar,"I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Airasia ground staff working at Makassar Airport especially the station manager Mr Jumadil. Few weeks ago, I had some issues with my baggage because the company I bought my flight ticket online (kiwi) did not purchase it for me with Airasia. So the latest request that I pay again for my luggage, the only problem I couldn&#8217;t cause my credit card wasn&#8217;t working and I didn&#8217;t have enough money with me. So, I was in a bit of jumble there. <br />Crazy as its seems the two companies don&#8217;t have any means to communicate even though millions of people must use both their services to fly all around Asia. Anyway, the ground staff of Airasia and Mr. Jumadil especially helped me offering an internet connexion, food; water and comfort untill my issue got solved. I really appreciated their help and humanity, which have become rare lately. So thank you again from the bottom of my heart"
1,I have bad experience with Airasia&#8230;,"I have bad experience with Airasia crew, their service is not really good although they are budget airlines but this doesn&#39;t mean we should be treated with unfriendly service either. And I see something  today in Instagram, the Airasia pilot was taking Medical Certificate (MC) leave just to celebrate birthday with his friends?! Pilot is paid with high salary not for their knowledge &amp; flying skill but also the responsibility. How could a pilot apply MC just for a birthday celebration and next day he went to bicycle shop to test new bicycle. I have print screen the photos as proof if Airasia team you such info for discipline action. <br /><br />Airasia team, I wish you will look into this and get this improved. The pilot should apply annual leave for his personal matter instead of medical leave, this is about ATTITUDE &amp; PERSONALITY problem. Although Airasia is budget airline but we do not want to take risk of our life either."
1,hands down the worst airline ever,hands down the worst airline ever. they charge you 4 to 5 times the price for everything. food is aweful. super expensive flight and anything over and above just the ticket is chargeable. frauds of the first order. They switch off the AC during takeoff and landing like a little taxi in traffic. Unfriendly and totally useless ground staff.
1,Terrible.,"Terrible.<br /><br />Flight delayed 5 hours at the last minute with no warning.<br /><br />No compensation, no refreshments, nothing. Just left to hang around the airport for 5 hours.<br /><br />Was told the reason was &quot;the flight arrived late&quot;."
1,"Special assistance, my foot! Literally!!","I have a damaged ankle, and can&#39;t walk more than a few steps at a time on crutches. I booked a Kuala Lumpur to Delhi flight, with special assistance service, for Mar 27 2019 @ 7pm from KLIA2.<br /><br />I called up Air Asia call center, and was told the following:<br /><br />Wheelchair will be available only at the check-in counter for my flight<br /><br />If I can&#39;t walk, then I should have come with someone(as if that someone will carry me physically inside. absurd!)<br /><br />From the KLIA2 taxi drop off point, to the departure terminal, is the food/shopping area that is maybe 50 meters or so. Those were the longest 50 meters of my life! It took me 20+ minutes to get across those 50 meters to reach the departure hall, get to counter Y for my flight, only to be told that I will have to get to counter V for wheelchair assistance(and NO, WE CAN&#39;T GET THE WHEELCHAIR HERE TO THIS COUNTER!)<br /><br />Naturally, I filled out a complaint form after catching my breath, on their website (there, can&#39;t even say the airline name anymore without getting upset), to which I got a scripted robotic response, followed by closure of my complaint ticket.<br /><br />I think the last time I went through such a physically and mentally exhaustive ordeal was a self-inflicted one, where I decided to go on a mountain trek of 7KMs in the upper reaches of the Himalyas. The pure torture of hobbling on two crutches across a total distance of ~100 meters was severely compounded by robotic responses and rude behavior of the staff."
2,AirAsia should change their slogan from&#8230;,AirAsia should change their slogan from &quot;Now Everyone Can Fly&quot; too &quot;Now Everyone Can Fly On A Terrible Airline&quot;
1,Very rude and unfriendly staff who have&#8230;,"Very rude and unfriendly staff who have no courtesy. Had a very bad experience at the bengaluru airport. Was travelling with a friend and two kids. Was late to the gate as we were in the washroom. We missed our flight as we were not allowed to board. That&#39;s not my pain. My pain is the attitude and the mismanagement of The manager Athira kishore and her colleague. And the inconvenience they caused us. They were very rude and unfriendly. And did not guide us at all, rather they just walked out on us. With two kids we were cluelessly standing trying to get pass security and get to the other side to book tickets. They just abandoned us on the airport rather than guiding us out. We were running around the airport trying to find them with kids hanging around our neck as the security guy told us that one staff has to guide us out. Very pathetic behavior. We are not slaves or beggars to go around looking for them. It was their job to guide us out. They took our boarding pass as well and didn&#39;t give them back. The boarding pass were required at the security check with a staff and their signatures to get out.And when we complained on the feedback form about them. THEY LIED saying they offered us the next flight with no charges. Horrible horrible experience. Never taking this airline again. My friend has a special child who is 3 who can&#39;t even sit properly on his own. She had to carry him around running around the airport because of these ladies. This is very unethical behavior on the part of AirAsia. Very very disappointed. Where the world is moving forward in women safety AirAsia is going 10 steps backwards because of such people who left two women with kids on the airport on their own."
2,It even a glass of water,"Wasn&#39;t able to check in online although they invited me to do so, send they just check everyone in regardless so how do they know how full the flight is. The queues were longest we&#39;d ever experienced, one hour to do what was basically a bag drop, never saw a safety briefing, no announcements, no landing cards given out, not even a drink of water offered but it can&#39;t be all bad as we were on time and they didn&#39;t lose my case"
1,NEVER EVER FLY AIRASIA!,"NEVER EVER FLY AIRASIA!<br />A REAL CON BY FAT TONY !!<br /><br />1. unwarranted delay for DNG - KUL route<br />(causing me to miss my connecting Flight)<br /><br />2. was forced to purchase new Ticket for KUL - KCH route<br />(AirAsia Staff at DNG Airport assured I would be compensated - refunded for purchasing new Ticket)  <br /><br />3. was advised by AirAsia Staff at DNG Airport that Refunds would take up to 3 months to be made<br /><br />4. after 5 months, no Refund has been made.<br /><br />5. checked on AirAsia online and engaged with Mumeenah via LiveChat<br /><br />6. Mumeenah provided FULL OF S@%T explanations, asking for all Emails by AirAsia etc. and I could not forward Emails to her, instead had to screen shot - a delay approach intentionally to loose all information within a stipulated timeframe on LiveChat<br /><br />7. disconnected with Mumeenah and after &#39;sometime&#39; connected back<br /><br />8. now cant upload the screenshot onto LiveChat - technical problem<br /><br />9. &quot;Mumeenah N: okay let me send the request file to you again&quot;. &quot;The agent has cancelled the file transfer request&quot;.<br /><br />After 8 times of sending the screenshot to her, she claimed to have received nothing.<br /><br />Realized AirAsia is FULL OF S@%T and NEVER AGAIN on AirAsia!!<br /><br />...determined to make an effort to spread the word on such unscrupulous Airlines ripping-off its clients.<br /><br />Hope to meet Fat Tony one day!"
1,Do yourself a favour and do not engage with this airline,"What I have experienced is the failing IT system, the unempthatic customer service and the lack of desire to regain customer trust.<br /><br />I have booked a flight to Narita with Air Asia X from Jakarta. Five months prior to the flight my booking was cancelled and planned for full refund. The cancellation of flight with such advance notice is acceptable due to flight reshuffling etc. What follows through had made me lost trust in this airline and I shalladvocate other passengers to fly other budget airlines. <br /><br />1. I opted for full refund to my bank account which was not acknowledged. I had to contact the customer service officer two times. (1hr wait each) for them to give me a confirmation of my decision. <br />2. The waiting for the refund went on for 3 months and I had to actively ask them on the status of the refund. <br />3. The original date of my departure passed, 5 months have gone and I have yet to receive my full refund.<br />4.  Email came two times in a span of two months staying that the money had been transferred to the account. No transfer registered in my bank account. I have performed due diligence (bank account and name are correct). There was no explanation offered by Air Asia.<br />5. Now close to a year since I made the booking I have yet to receive my full refund. Received an email where they offer an 150 percent credit of the refund amount. I feel flabbergasted they have the confidence that I will actually fly with Air Asia again. I respectfully asked for 150 percent of my refund amount to my bank account for all the inconvenience and the same sign of good will stemmed from the credit offer. <br />6. My case was prematurely closed by the customer officer even though I did not response to their explanation. This reply and close method is unacceptable and demonstrated that the customer service needs serious reorganisation.<br /><br />If Air Asia knows the concept of inflation, they returning my money a year later, will result in lower value compared to a year earlier. I find it extremely disappointing Air Asia did not possess the capability to expedite their own process for an planned cancellation such as this. Their failure to offer a appropriate compensation for the great inconvenience to me did not surmount to their claim as the best budget airline. <br /><br />This review alone will not make an impact to such a large corporation. I vow not to fly Air Asia no matter how attractive the offer is and to spread this experience to anyone is considering to fly with Air Asia. <br /><br />Best regards<br />Hardi Njo"
1,AIRASIA AGENTS DO NOT TELL THE TRUTH,"I booked flights for travel with Airasia through OPODO (NEVER USE THEM EITHER) and they made a mistake in the names on the tickets. I eventually had to deal directly with Airasia and they told me that Higher Management had approved a full refund if I rebooked the same flights again and once I had the reservation number I could come back to them and they would issue a full refund.  I did this on 20th February at a cost of AUD2439.90 (having already paid over Euro1200 in January.  I am still waiting for this promised refund.  I have been on their live chat several times and having raised a further complaint, have now been advised that I can have travel credit which has to be used in 90 days!! I live in Ireland so this is not acceptable.  I would NOT HAVE REBOOKED these flights if I had not been promised a full refund and would have reverted to OPODO to sort out the matter as they made the mistake.  Customer Service in Airasia is apalling.  They do not tell the truth"

3,Overall airport review,"As a Malaysian , I would like to suggest that our country need various improvements to establish a better impression to foreign tourists visiting our country.  With these improvements , this will definitely boost to attract more foreign tourists to visit our country. Base on my observation , I found that directory signboards are only written in Bahasa Malaysia and Bahasa Inggeris, since there are many tourists from various countries such as Japan, China and Korea who might not be well versed in Bahasa Inggeris and of course Bahasa Malaysia,  thus one of the improvements is to include foreign languages of the Japanese, korean and Chinese in the directory signboard.<br /><br />Secondly, I had observed another issue that improvement  can be made is the attitude of the custom officers. Below is one of the case which I had Personally observed :  I noticed that  majority of the officers on duty are being so restless and impatient,  when there was a Japanese tourist asking for the direction to carry out  custom check, because  he could  not understand the languages on the directory signboard, the custom officer replied to him rudely and showed to the tourist the direction with a very impolite and impatient attitude. <br /><br />In addition, I found that there is no officer to guide the tourists along the way from where their flight is landed until where they shall collect the baggages.  Even worse, the baggage claim area was so crowded and messy as the people were not queuing properly to collect their own baggages. There were no officers on duty to give instruction and assist  the people and to make sure that they do not cross the yellow line while waiting for their baggages. It was just like pandemonium!  <br /><br />Apart from that, the baggages to be collected from the the conveyor belt were so badly thrown and good order, many people could not collect their baggage smoothly and they were forced to pull their baggages from the conveyor belt. This was definitely causing damages to the other baggages, for example scratching the other baggages. I am not sure about the reasons to this issue but I strongly suggest that strict while polite officers shall be placed to help out the situation.<br />Lastly, I definitely  hope that Malaysia airports can take these issues seriously, and seek for improvements soonest possible so that the foreign tourists can have good experience either visiting or flying back home from our country&#8217;s airports."
1,I just flew from hyderabad to sydney on&#8230;,I just flew from hyderabad to sydney on March 2 under booking code 56442148 - Matthew Heidema. I learned on the day that I had no baggage paid for and the desk man said it would cost 20000 rupees for my 20kg bag. I said let me unload some stuff and reorganize which i did - got it down to 15kg for which he said he&#39;d charge 10353 rupees. This still seemed very expensive to me so i looked online to find what the regular price would be and couldn&#39;t find anything quoted. Then i phoned customer service to investigate further and learned that the man had charged me for 18kg worth of luggage and that i only should have had to pay between 4000 and 5000 rupees - half this amount but there was nothing she could do about it and directed me to something called ava. I need someone to help me with this because I feel completely ripped off and lied to by this guy in hyderabad.  Still don&#39;t know who to talk to
1,Customer care and service recovery - in shambles!!,"I have flown AirAsia on many Asian holidays over the years. For a low cost carrier, it generally gets you there safe and happy. However 9 out of 10 flights they ALWAYS delay/change/reschedule flights. <br /><br />I have a booking for Easter 2019 from SYD-Phuket. On 18 Feb 2019 they informed me that my homebound flight had been cancelled by the airline. New flights delayed us by 28 hours getting home. I was told any change/ refund requests were to go through their online system. This is where the saga starts (and is still continuing)...<br /><br />1)  Once the online forms are submitted, AirAsia gets 7 working days to reply. They will not even read your request, it&#8217;s a pure cut and paste template requesting more info. That&#8217;s usually day 4. If you reply back to that email, you&#8217;ll get a reply from AirAsia (meaning they did get the email!) but that the &#8220;care team&#8221; could not be reached. Day 5-6, air Asia sends you an email to say they will &#8220;close the case due to no response&#8221;. So, not only are your requests totally ignored but you get standardised templated responses, you also endlessly get your emails &#8220;closed&#8221;. <br /><br />2) when following up on the phone with customer care, they are polite but have zero authority to help. All they do is &#8220;escalate&#8221; your request to &#8220;the correct department&#8221;. So you re-start a new 7 day wait!! Whereupon they will send you a nice reply requesting reconfirmation of passenger names and more info required!! <br /><br />3) being smart I saved every correspondence and pdf the entire saga. Then back onto the online form to REPLY to them about their info requirements, the bank account details they want to reconfirm for a refund. I get a reply with a &#8220;new case number&#8221;. Day 4, I get a &#8220;we are closing this case soon &#8220;due to no reply&#8221;. And so the calls and emails continue again!!! <br /><br />15 days later, 4 phone calls, 8 emails, and yet, AirAsia has dragged out a simple case into a customer care saga!!! They have a huge lack of understanding how to treat customers. Their IT system is in shambles. Their customer service staff have no authority beyond taking phone calls and passing your message along. <br /><br />Wake up, AirAsia! How can you run a business with totally lack of customer care!!"
1,"Totally Incompetent and at Fault, Ignoring All Your Requests","Very first time I used AirAsia for my 10 year anniversary break around Asia.<br />1. They cancelled/retired a flight and put me on the next flight.<br />2. Due to transfers, this did not work, I requested it to be changed to the earlier flight.<br />3. Customer support by email, AirAsia webpage and Twitter were a disgrace. Most times they didnt listen.  If they responded about doing stuff, they didnt do it.<br />4. After 20 days, having wasted enough time, I requested a full refund which I am entitled to.  They ignored this request and instead rescheduled the flights and completely the wrong flights.  I have given up on this and they have no idea what they are doing.<br /><br />Most times it might be ok, but any unexpected changes happen, then expect hell.  Save yourself stress, go for another airline.  Not worth it."
1,!FRAUDSTERS: If it would be in EU it would be FRAUDULENT TRADE PRACTICES with penalties up to 10% of annual sales!!,"(Suppoprt case 10706024)<br /><br />I have a flight 24.02.2019,and I wanted to change the date of this fight.<br /><br />I tried to do it on 20.02.2019 and 21.02.2019 in AirAsia mobile application, it retruned unspecified ERROR for modification of my booking.<br /><br />I trie dto do it on the website - I was changed exactly same flights, exactly same airports, the system returned the error message:<br /><br />&quot;Due to the airport code change, please be aware that there may be fare discrepancies when you change  flights. To process these changes please contact our live chat agents, lodge your request through our online form or contact your local call center. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, thank you!&quot;<br />- that is complete NON-SENSE as &quot;airport codes&quot;have not been changed in any manner.<br /><br />So, I followed instructions form the last error message, and contacte dtheir Live Chat Agent.<br /><br />Agent Nr. 1 was really dumb, and, albeit I booked my flight with BIG Member discount, and my booking shows also under my BIG Profile, he said that my booking wa snot linked to my BIG profile, he allegedly &quot;repaired it&quot;, and it was the reason why I wasnot able to modify my booking online, and now I should be able to proceed ))<br /><br />Of course, it didnt work, and the system returned an exactly the same error message.<br />SO I JUST WASTED MY TIME ON COMMUNICATION WITH THE DUMB AGENT NR.1.<br /><br />I contacted Live Chat Agent Nr.2 - after heraing what the matter is, he just hang up.<br />SO I JUST WASTED MY TIME ON COMMUNICATION WITH THE DUMB AGENT NR.2.<br /><br />Then I contacted Live Chat Agent Nr. 3, who told me:<br />- the problem is with AirAsia IT systems, that is why I am unable to modify my booking myself.<br />- I should visit in person AirAsia sales office or authorised agent and make change of date booking with them;<br />( impplying the error message above is wrog itself not only about &quot;changing airport codes&quot; (WHAT A JOKE! :D ) but also about being able under these circumstances to modify my booking via live chat agent or phone agent channels).<br /><br />I responded that it is BS - I am not now at a location where AirAsia has a sales office or even authroized agen, and will not be for a quite time; when I booked online I relied that I will be able to cahnge a date if flight remotedly also, without a need of in person visiting AirAsia or its agent premises; it is a fault of AirAsia - IT system not working so taht I am unable to modify the booking myself, also IT system not working so that Live Agent is unable to do that as well; more over so much smelling garbage of simply wrog and misleading announcements and feedback from AirAsia.<br /><br />They are actually are putting obstacles into exercising my rights to change a date of flight - that is , if it would be in EU or Australia 0 but also according to MALAYSIA LAW ALSO, putting all kinds of obstacles to negatively affect lawful consumer&#39;s exercising of its rights consitutues so called Unfair Trade Parctices, that is punishable in amny EU countries up to 10% of annaul sales penalty ( and authorities do charge such penalties).<br /><br />Live Agent Nr.3 responded to me that I will be contacted to my Gmail , citing, correctly, few times my email adress, to perform my requested change of dates of my flight.&#39;<br /><br />I told her, that if they are unable to execute a change of dates for my flight remotedly, as absence of such mode is PURE FAILURE OF AIR ASIA, then let they refund me. Same goes that I should not incur some extra expenses becuas eof modifying my boooking not online, or because the fare (which I screenshoted) to which  I wanted to swap for the new dates, is not anymore available.<br /><br />GUESS?<br /><br />NO EMAIL THEY SEND ME, OF COURSE!!!! - PURE LIES THAT THEY WOULD SEND.<br /><br />My flights depart around 06:00 on 24.02.2019.<br /><br />When today, after I woke up and had a breakfast, I tried to access again modification of my booking option online, may be it is working ( but can&#39;t know for sure, as ERROR message appeared AFTER I chose a desired new flight date and times, and press proceed button) BUT I was told that my flight Fare Rules not allow me to change flight date less than 48 hours before the flight.<br /><br />( On separate note, I was trying yesterday, to establish details of my Fare Rules - and GUESS! - it is NOWHERE CAN EB FOUND!!! - neither you have it online - as all other airlines, when you open booking you can access, nor I ahve it in my confirmation email; also I tried to establsih fare rules for  a particular itinerary - AirAsia website offer such theroretical option, but ALAS! when you try to use it, enetreing an airport of origin and detsination, it say ERROR ERROR :D)<br /><br />So,<br /><br />1. AirAsia failed with their IT systems, as online, in mobile app DIY mofification of dates, to which I am eligible, were not available .<br />2. AirAsia failed with their IT systems as such modifictaion were not available also via Live Chat Agents or by phone ( as per Live Chat Agent Nr.3 communication).<br />3. Air Asia failed to resolve my problem about my initially sought modification of dates , and even more AirAsia grossly and greatly failed to keep up with its own promises - to contact me by an email yesterday to make the change of dates of the said booking.<br />4. AirAsia practicised Unfair Trade Practices , also under Malaysian Consumer Protection law ( will atke a lok how to complain aboput it to authorties..)<br />5. I am now with a ticket with old date, AirAsia systems says I am now behind a 48 hours of rescheduling flight ( yes, I waited for tehir email, and at 6:15 this mrning I stul had  sweet dreams - not my job to wake uo 4AM to check once again if email arrived ( yesterday we had a chat with Live Agent Nr. 3 around 13:00..) or try to execute modification myself).<br /><br />I WANT REFUND, I DONT WANT TO FY ANYMORE WITH AIRASIA TO FUND SALARIES OF THESE UNPROFESSIONAL BARINLESS PEOPLE.<br /><br />I book my flight same itinerary with other airline to allow funding of unprofesionalism and dumbness.<br /><br />And yes, of course, I have made screenshot of those chats with Live Agent to publish later as an anecdote)"
1,Cheap And Nasty,"Using their website to manage any stage of your booking could seriously shorten your life. It&#39;s badly (or perhaps very well) designed to frustrate you whether it&#39;s checking in/printing boarding pass/sending the barcode to your phone/modifying your booking.. etc, etc. And at the airport, as you&#39;re left with no choice but to print your boarding cards from one of their kiosks, that is another level of pain altogether. As a &quot;cheap&quot; airline with very few competitors in that region, they have become very inefficient and arrogant. Make them your Hobson&#39;s choice."
1,worst service in my life,"During Chinese new year, my parents  booked a ticket  back to Johor, when we booked the ticket the time shown for the flight is 7.15am.When we went to the airport , we realized that the time for the flight change to 7.00am.They did not informed us, so we quickly went to the self check-in machine and check in .The machine show that we cant check-in anymore because  we must check-in 1hour before the time for the flight. The time was 6.20 am when we reach the customers service for Airasia, The girl at the counter tell us we must check in 45 min  before <br />the flight, we explained to her about that they did not informed us about the change of time,and ask can she help us. She  rejected us and she doesn&#39;t want to help ,she say is our problem did not arrived on time. But the problem is the plane just started boarding, is possible to board the plane on time.  After a few min, she call the air stewardess.After the call ,she told us we are not able to check-in.My mum beg her and she still refuse to try to call again. In the end, we miss the flight and my parents are not able to have dinner with grandma ,if we will able the check-in when the time we ask her, we will not miss the flight and waste our money."
3,Shanghai - Manila 2018 (twice),"Have used it to fly Shanghai - Manila return. The actual flight was ok and not delayed, which is something that happens in China quite a lot. Booking a ticket using the official website is difficult due to the fact the site does not seem to work properly, so I used a different one instead - Trip.com which does. Service on board the aircraft was OK although the air stewards do not miss an opportunity to make a quick buck when it comes to selling things to passengers.<br /><br />The check in at Manila is good with e-check boarding pass printer in that actually works and saves an awful amount of time if no check in luggage to put on the plane. However the check in at Shanghai Pudong is typically Chinese and tedious as they do not allow online check in so have to line up even if just one carry on bag. The check in staff at Pudong are also typically cold and unfriendly (as is most of the airport actually). <br /><br />You get what you pay for but this budget airline is not too bad and the Manila check in was a nice hassle free experience."
1,Low quality airline AIRASIA,"Nevery trust upon this low cost  rather low quality airlines. My baggage has been missing for last one year and the only support I receive from the airlines is an email once in a Blue moon asking me if I have received my missing luggage. Perhaps the staff in the concerned department is either illiterate  or sort of blind  If The missing luggage had been delivered  to me, it must of been got signed from me. Then, what is  the strategy behind sending emails with asking such question?"
4,Content to fly Air Asia,"I realise I may just be lucky but am a happy customer.First the bad .... have only had a couple of issues in several years of flying multiple flights with Air Asia.<br />  Recently at KUL I was turned back at the security gate  for having a laptop and a backpack weighing more than 7 kg <br />I was unaware of this and was very annoyed but was early and could put my carryon case into checkin again for no extra charge and the checkin staff were sympathetic.I also was not able to book a fly through ticket from Suratthani to Sydney and lost my premium free lounge pass because I couldn&#8217;t exit and re enter at KUL without <br />checkin in again ..still confused on that one.<br />To my horror Air Asia have ceased their partnership with Optiontown which previously got me great seat and flattish bed options for a very low cost.<br />Very sad to see KUL to Suratthani route has been axed .<br />However ,I have never been delayed on Air Asia (!!) unlike Jetstar and Qantas.<br />The FAs are young and cheerful and good value.<br />The self booking site is tricky the first time but practise makes perfect.<br />Quiet zone ie no kids is a boon.<br />The routes are great; the food is ok on Thai Air Asia in particular.<br />Planes are clean ,a little bumpy at times being smaller A320s.<br />The big plus is a flythru ticket early in the morning gets you out of the melee of DMK airport immigration and into a transit lounge with your own designated immigration official to stamp your passport !!<br />All in all will keep flying them happily"
1,They deserve 0 star,They deserve 0 star. Their website is faulty and unstable yet they refused to admit their mistakes and made consumer pay for their shortfalls. Took 1 month to respond to my case and was not helpful at all when I finally received a respond. They will be my last option as a flight service provider.
1,Budget to the max,"They email you to show up 4 hours prior to flight. Once I arrived, I asked to get on an earlier flight, and was told only if my flight was delayed. Well guess what... 2 hour flight delay plus 1 hour sitting on the tarmac. Asked for a water and was told 50 peso&#8217;s. You would think at least a complimentary water would be offered at this point."
1,The worst airlines ever....too&#8230;,The worst airlines ever....too slow...too urorganized....all flights of all times to all destinations on one counter...you must be in thr airport 5 hours perior to your flight departure...they made me miss my flight for 6 mins late because they intend to be very slow and when I suggested to fly and ship my baggage in the next flight they refused and forced me to buy a new ticket from KL to Langkawi...non respectful company...last time I fly on airasia
5,"Quick, online, perfect...","Nowadays I like to give credit as soon as I see something good happening. It is so easy to criticise everything, that I am trying a different, more positive approach...<br />I made a name mistake one of the 3 bookings I just did with AirAsia. I immediately contact them via their automated chat, got through to a real person (but still via automated chat), and resolved the issue in less than 5 minutes. No questions, no phone calls, nothing. The way customer service should be in 2019. Thanks AirAsia"
1,Don&#8217;t Bother,Customer service? Non existent.  Value for money? Smoke and mirrors.  Better options available? You bet!
1,Bad customer service experience,"Hi, <br /><br />I am posting a review here with the hope that a representative from AirAsia will handle my case.<br /><br />Please refer to the case ID 08721730 and 08721344<br /><br />Briefly, AirAsia delayed and rescheduled the flight from Kota Kinabalu to Singapore from 26 Nov to 27 Nov. I am hoping to claim some direct incidental costs from AirAsia.<br /><br />I previously submitted my case twice but unfortunately and frustratingly, AirAsia failed to respond at all. I made a follow up call last night, surprisingly, the agent said AirAsia &quot;closed&quot; my case. I was extremely shocked - AirAsia did not even attempt to contact me before unilaterally decided closing my case, not even mentioning the accountability on the serious flight delay.<br /><br />I am a regular customer, but now I have very little confidence on how AirAsia handles the customer service. <br /><br />Appreciate if someone can assist with this and take actions! <br /><br />Thank you,<br />CT"
1,Terrible airline will never fly again&#8230;,Terrible airline will never fly again constantly change their flight times unreliable airline company
1,Useless Customer Service,"Air Asia cancelled two of my flights to/from Indonesia, and it took me weeks, several online &quot;forms&quot; and eventually a visit to an Air Asia office at Don Mueang Airport in Bangkok before they put me on alternative flights. &quot;Online Chat&quot; was always busy and unobtainable.<br /><br />That was in November. I now find that a December 18 flight from Kuala Lumpur to Kathmandu (and back in January) was cancelled, WITHOUT NOTIFICATION, in August. The result meant I only found out at KLIA2 airport on December 18. My refund claim is in but given past experience, I doubt it will be resolved without my visiting an Air Asia office again.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE 30/12/18: Air Asia refunded my money yesterday, 11 days after I applied for it, so fair play on that score. HOWEVER, if they had acted properly in the first place, and told me that they had cancelled my return flights in August, I could have made other arrangements, and not wasted time and money going to Kuala Lumpur. So the star-rating remains unchanged. A shambles..."
3,&quot;....Dear Air Asia India,"&quot;....Dear Air Asia India, <br />I am Naveen Kumar and i am a regular domestic traveler .I would like to express my appreciation and thankfulness to the staff of Air Asia I5- 773 coming from Delhi to Goa on 19 Dec 2018. I suddenly got Cold and headaches in the flight and the flight attendants ( specially Miss Deepika) helped us giving the medicine, I am very thankful to you for the much needed help you have provided to us. I will definitely fly with Air Asia India in the future also. <br />Suggestion -<br />Please improve your customer care training system ( for more feedback@call on my number  Mob: +91- 9049346435)"

1,Air Asia makes us pay for their system bug,"We have just booked a flight online on the Air Asia web site.  Everything seemed fine when booking, we booked for March 18 flight from Hong Kong to Chiang Mai.  When we got our confirmation we noticed it was for March 19.  I logged into their portal and saw that the birth dates of  all three passengers was one day earlier than the actual birth dates.<br />I have booked many many times online with various airlines and have never made date mistakes because I double check my dates before doing the final submit.<br />I thought, well, is there a chance I entered the wrong date so I hit the back button multiple times in my browser to get back to the original booking request page, it showed March 18.<br />I suspect the date issue is because we are one day off time zone wise.<br />It is also strange that the booking date was one day later and the birth dates was one day earlier.  <br />We called them and told them there must be a bug on their website because all the dates were incorrect.  We asked them to change the booking and birth dates to what they should be.  We were told changing birth dates they could do after we emailed them our passport photos, which I would kind of accept.  Wasn&#39;t comfortable with emailing passport info.<br />We sent them all the screen shots we could from our browser but to no avail.<br />We got email bounced messages from three different email accounts, yet they did receive the email when we called them yet again to complain.<br />The worst was, they would not change the travel date without charging us change fees which would cost more than the price of the original ticket.  To add insult to injury, we purchased cancellation insurance which they said could not be used.<br />My advice to travelers, use them at your own risk.  We have just lost a bunch of money on a ticket we cannot use for something that is their fault.  We couldn&#39;t cancel on our credit card either because they are protected by policy.<br />This whole incident leaves me feeling the airline has bad business practices, it leaves me wondering if this is done on purpose based on their unwillingness to listen to reason."
4,This is a genuine testimony,"This is a genuine testimony, and relates only to my flying experiences with Air Asia X, which extends from when this airline flew from London Stanstead airport to KLIA LCT, up to November 12th 2018 Sydney to KLIA2.and includes Vietnam return.<br />In terms of inflight service and aircraft, this airline should be the national carrier of Malaysia. The cabin crew are young and enthusiastic, and the Airbus A330-300 is comfortable, especially if you know where to sit, added to which there is no stupid insistence on having the window blinds pulled down during datime flights. It is a low-cost airline so passengers fly knowing what the fare has purchased, so no complaints about food or the need to purchase extras. I am in the over 65 age bracket and a regular long haul passenger."

No response from airasia for refund confirmation! <br /><br />Anyone who could help??  Where to go for the next step!<br /><br />Someone from airasia! I need for refund confirmation ASAP!
1,Terrible Customer service,"Terrible Customer service<br /><br />They are not even trying to help you out when you require explanations. The multi-city function on the website is broken, it bring you to this very old interface where you can only book to specific cities. They change the terms and conditions multiple times. <br /><br />Overall very deceiving experience. I wish to never fly with them again."
1,Worst customer service ever,"Worst customer service ever! <br />We bought a giftcard from AirAsia&#39;s website. However, when you buy it you wont receive the giftcard before 7 days later, which they dont tell you in T&amp;C until you have made your payment - however this is edited in T&amp;C now, but we still did not get the money back. Next, the value of a giftcard has to be used for only one purchase, so if you have a giftcard of $300 and buys tickets worth $200, the remaining is lost."
1,Flight Cancellation twice without notification and Delay again,"We bought return tickets in early March 2018, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Osaka in end October 2018. There were 2 cancellations made by AirAsia without notice or whatsoever. Both had no notice or email given until we noticed the changes ourselves when we were on the website. <br /><br />The 1st cancellation was made somewhere in June to early July, original flight to Osaka canceled and they moved it to 2 days later than the original. We filed complaints through email and Twitter, and expressed our dissatisfaction on the cancellation and changes without notice immediately, and request for flight change as the date is not preferable. Entitled for free reschedule, we moved the date to early November. <br /><br />The 2nd cancellation was made soon after the reschedule done in early July till early August, same scenario as previous, no notification! We noticed the changes ourselves in the website, filed another complaint through Twitter, and the only thing we can do is either get a refund or free reschedule. Nothing else. Noticed there were complaints about the delays and difficulties in getting the refund from AirAsia, we decided to make another flight reschedule to late November.<br /><br />Our departure flight now is 1.55am on 24 November (tomorrow). And this early morning (today) we received an email informing us that there will be a delay in our flight for 2 hours. We are now so frustrating and yet worried there will be another delay in the flight later.<br /><br />Another note, the response from AirAsia&#39;s customer care or support team is very disappointing. The response received from Twitter somewhat acceptable, which they took about 5 hours to 1 day to reply, but as long as you have decided the date to reschedule to, they somehow managed to get it done quickly. However, there was no response from our email complaints about the first cancellation that we made in mid-July, until end-August where we have already made our second reschedule (in mid-August) after the second cancellation without notice. And the email was only reflecting the first cancellation and first reschedule that we made in July. Soon after the email, Cancellation Notice was sent to my inbox to notify the first cancellation, after 2 months, and it wasn&#39;t even valid at that time anymore."
5,Cheap &amp; reliable,Cheap &amp; reliable. Best choice to go all over Asia without being bankrupted.
1,Zero customer service,"I have flown for many years &amp; many flight&#8217;s with AirAsia, but this was my last flight with AirAsia, flight FD 131 Jaipur to Bangkok 18/19th November 2018. I asked for a glass of normal filtered water to take my blood thinning tablets, I was given a cup of luke warm water, when they came around trying to sell putrid smelling food, I asked for a cup of cold water &amp; was refused by the steward SCC Worawit Soparkditha Pong, saying we sell bottles of water only. In 37 years of flying this was the first time this has happened, wow AirAsia has really become Thai style, money money money!!!!! &amp; All of this was after being delayed for 1 hour 10 minutes, with no apology. Omg AirAsia what has happened to your customer service?"
3,Two compaints.,High fees using payment cards. What it a standard payment method all over the world they call &quot;Convenience fee&quot;.<br />They SPAM quite a big with no consideration to previous settings.<br />Other than that everything as expected.<br />Fine service.
1,WORST handling of a complaint EVER,"ERASE AIRASIA<br /><br />So I have been trying for over 3 months to get a refund on a flight where there was a problem with the booking. I had to book another flight, a real ordeal in Danang, Vietnam, where their Payoo system didn&#39;t work and their office was closed for no reason.<br /><br />The worst part is how they handle customer complaint. This is how they operate.<br /><br />They tell you to submit a case filling a form.<br />They answer your complaint in a quick, unsatisfactory manner.<br />You answer with arguments.<br />They close the case without your consent.<br /><br />Obviously your case is not resolved and you have to open the case again, expain etc.<br />I must have sent about 50 messages with evidence, pictures, screenshots, etc<br /><br />I am really sick of either their stupidity or bad faith.<br />They hardly read the complaint, or pretend they miss the point.<br />Either way they are useless in handling the case.<br /><br />AVOID and SHARE"
4,Don&#39;t worry,"So, we just had a flight with Airasia Manila to Puerto princesa. We&#39;re very scared after reading all these awful reviews here, but everything was ok. Be careful with transaction fees (£6) and man what person would give you spaghetti bolognese on flight :D"
1,#AirAsia - BROKEN CUSTOMER SUPPORT SYSTEM,"In early September 2018 forced to request cancellation of a holiday trip from UK to India due to unforeseen medical problem requiring internal surgery. Notified #AirAsia and requested cancellation of flights booked for late October 2018 within India and refund of ticket price. #AirAsia system opens a case number and requests supporting docs to be submitted. But this message comes from a &quot;No Reply&quot; email address so if used it sends back a &quot;Not Delivered&quot; message! Then after 7 days #AirAsia system notifies that due to no response received from customer the case is closed. I have now opened 4 consecutive cases and all do the same thing. Despite giving #AirAsia over one month notice (which means they can then sell seats to other passengers, we have lost full price of two return tickets. I agree with the other reviewers that #AirAsia have designed their system to prevent passengers successful claims. We recommend people to NOT USE #AirAsia. Review posted 15 OCT 2018.

1,Thai AirAsia is truly the world&#39;s worst airline,"I wish I had come here first.  AirAsia - or Thai AirAsia as it is called on my bookings - is by far the worst airline I have ever experienced with EVERY SINGLE ONE of the flights i booked in Thailand - 4!! - changing from anywhere from 2 hours to almost 6.  Each one, of course, is tied to various connection and transfers which now no longer work.... but their policy is to only refund changes of more than 3 hours.  Unbelievable."
1,Ridiculous Payment Processing Charge for Problematic Payment Processing System,"The payment processing never seems to be working, yet AirAsia is charging a whopping 40sgd for payment via credit/debit card. Other air operator from Malaysia will not have these issues, nor do they charge their customer for &quot;Processing&quot; the payment."
1,worst irresponsible commercial Airline.,"worst irresponsible commercial Airline.<br /><br />I&#39;m a frequent flyer around the world. I was supposed to travel with AirAsia recently but the worst thing happened. They denied me from checking in, claiming it is a visa issue related to a transit that I should not expect to care about by them. They had the knowledge I can&#39;t checkin apparently but due to their worst procedures and lacking processes, they didn&#39;t tell me anything when I bought the ticket or checked in online. I was refused checking in on the spot at the airport. It cost me a fortune to buy a contingency ticket with another airline on the night itself to not have my holiday fully ruined by these guys! I filed a complaint but I can&#39;t smell any responsiveness. On the contrary, the staff I spoke to face to face at the airport were completely irresponsible to the damage caused, refusing to even refund me anything, not to mention about the HUGE inconvenience and costs on me buying alternative flight, losing time of my holiday, staying in hotels temporarily and losing stays in other hotels. It is just terrible terrible experience.<br /><br />Don&#39;t throw away your money. Add more pennies and choose another airline to not lose all your money and holiday with this horrible airline!"
1,A business model - don&#39;t care to assist if your father dies,"Had to cancel trip from Japan to KL today. My father passed away and we are all in grief and trying to settle things. <br />Trying to reduce impact of damages we also try to cnx AirAsia trip. <br />Have now spend up to 5 hours on call, chat and filling in webforms. No succes<br />IT&#39;S A BUSINESS MODEL.<br />Not to deal with cancellations. We are not asking for ticket refund, just refund of fuel surcharge and airline taxes. Which we are entitled to. And AirAsia will get refunded once we do not board. So<br />REFUND -&gt; AIRASIA<br /><br />Fly AirAsia - it&#39;s a great airline to book and board. <br />Dont expect anything else.Keep that in mind"

1,I would NEVER recommend this airline to anyone,"I would NEVER recommend this airline to ANYONE . Their customer service is HORRIBLE . Please understand that I only write bad reviews if my experience was just so bad to the point that I&#8217;ve cried or got really angry . In this case both . My round trip flight from Saigon to Phuket should have cost me no more that $130 . But I ended up spending a total of $270 because they charged me to check my bag twice . They charged me $40 to check my bag from Saigon to Bangkok(a 3 hour layover ) . And then $57 from Bangkok to Phuket . They said they couldn&#8217;t let my bag go all the way to Phuket from Saigon for some odd reason. Basically a money hungry scam of a airline They are a horrible company. One of the ladies was soooo rude to me that I actually ended up crying because I was already having a bad experience with them . Do yourself a favor and please avoid . We pay too much money to fly to just be treated like crap and get bombarded with hidden fees . I will be posting this same review where else I can, that&#8217;s how much I really dislike this airline and how hurt I am from my experience"
3,Used the services of this airline a few&#8230;,"Used the services of this airline a few times. The staff are polite. If you want to eat on board, then it&#39;s better to plan this beforehand, by buying a lunch with the ticket, you can save money. The choice of food is not bad. A significant disadvantage for me was the refusal of free drinking water. Even when I said that I was ill and I needed to take a pill, water was not given."
1,"Airasia is bad airlines, No commitment","Airasia is bad airlines, I had book from Jkt - Narita, the ticket had issue, about 1 month after booking, I get email from airasia to cancel that route.<br />They just give 3 option.<br />1. Reschedule<br />2. Another route with transit<br />3. refund<br />As you know, 3 option that they give all is disadvantage for passanger, and no one advantage.<br />I dont think, as big airlines in asia, will no commitment. just a LIER, with poor customer service especially name ALDI. Can not give solution.<br />I think the Goverment must be give them punishment to Airasia."

1,High fees with VISA credit card,"High fees with VISA credit card, they are trying earn more money with non sense fee for use credit card, you can find cheap price, but last step (complete payment) is trap..<br /><br />for one trip = 12 USD, for two persons = 24 USD fees for use credit card..<br /><br />As programmer i implemented many payment gateways and fees are not necessary, each cent there is just trap and business how to earn money for nothing.."
1,Terrible website and app,"AirAsia is guilty of being wholly uncaring and totally incapable when booking new flights, and of entrapping their customers so that they are forced to pay additional fees due to the incompetence of their web designers.<br /><br />Firstly, paying with the app absolutely does not work. The payment will never go through, despite attempting it at different times over several days with different debit and credit cards.<br /><br />When using the website should you provide your personal details and make an account, the website itself will fill it in for you. This in itself would not be a problem, however it will incorrectly fill in this form, forcing you to waste your valuable time and money receiving a re-issuance of your ticket. This in itself would be not worthy of a bad review, but the fact that it has the CORRECT information in its database and proceeds to fill in the INCORRECT information in its passenger details section is truly entrapment at its most depraved, giving the false sense of confidence that they could design a website capable of having a function a 5 year old could implement, namely copying and pasting information correctly in its entirety."
1,Absolutely disgraceful,"Absolutely disgraceful! Ill mannered and completely useless support staff!<br /><br />Made a purchase via their website. The details of the flight were all okay as we went through to payment- then when it came up as complete (after payment) the names had changed to some random cookie grabbed mess!!!<br /><br />This was 1 MONTH AGO!!<br /><br />Their solution is that we buy more flights and in return get useless credit for our previous flight. AKA &quot;pay us more money and we will maybe (yes they used the word maybe) give you credit you wont have any use for&quot; basic extortion.<br /><br />They refuse to communicate with mastercard, they refuse to answer our claim officially by email. We have provided screenshots showing them the issue with the website happen again and again as well as screenshots proving we typed our own names into the booking! As well as a video showing it! <br /><br />It took me over 17hours to even get through to their livechat, it has now taken a whole month and their answer is &quot;we need time&quot; &quot;we cant do that&quot;. I put in a complaint about how long this took and they simply closed it without even looking into it once. They just close cases and do not provide answers! Their attitude is awful and they constantly try to mislead me into agreeing to their poor offer by saying they will give me the credit first and then going back on it.<br /><br />They basically think that I will cave because it is my holiday, they act like blackmailers. I&#39;m astonished at how awful they are and that they are allowed to operate on such a grand scale!<br /><br />They have provided me with a product I didn&#39;t buy, refuse to change it or give me a refund and they think &quot;no we can&#39;t&quot; is somehow acceptable to that- it&#39;s theft! Complete and utter scum. <br /><br />Unfortunately I booked with them previously also and have just found out they charged me the incorrect amount and in the incorrect currency for that too! <br /><br />AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS, IT IS NOT WORTH IT"
1,Terrible experience with Air Asia,"Terrible experience to travel with Air Asia<br />we paid full amount of ticket from Colombo to Bali and they stop us at the counter because our payment was not in the system!!!!!!<br />I called my bank, they confirm money transaction (# 038287 air asia Philippine) but they didn&#39;t let us fly until we pay AGAIN to fly.<br />Now it is 10 days I am waiting for my refund and no body is responsible.<br />please be care full and think twice before purchasing ticket from Air Asia.<br />Pouyan<br />+94777660045"
1,They canceled flights been trying to&#8230;,They canceled flights been trying to get in contact for nearly 2weeks emails live chat and Twitter spent hours on all these and still have not resolved issue no refund no other flights. After using air Asia for a lot of years will never use them again. I think they are scamming me. Live chat does not work . Twitter not responding been on there since2pm it is now 6pm and still no answers.
1,The flight from KL to Terengganu has&#8230;,The flight from KL to Terengganu has been changed for outward and return. We had previously booked seats for both flights and since the change we do not have our reserved seats when we go back into the web site. We have emailed them and asked for a refund but we are concerned that the exercise is a money building one but we can&#39;t actually confirm that as they have not yet replied to our request for a refund. Given the same concerns on this page we have a feeling that our suspicions may be right but please Air Asia prove us wrong.It would be an awful shame if this was an habitual relentless way for an airline to increase wealth by this trick if this is what they are doing and the ruined day it has caused to our let arrival and return day as it is not only about cost. Sometimes if you pay too little you have to pay twice. (John Ruskin) We will say if they actually do or do not give the refund.
1,Customer support doesn&#39;t exist,"Customer support doesn&#39;t exist! tried all options (live chat, email, messenger.... and in Malaysia call only dedicated for AA X passenger! ) but TOTALLY NO RESPOND from AA! terrible! <br />AA cancelled my flight, moved to earlier flight. Initial booking with value pack and i&#39;d picked my seat. When they resend new itinerary, surprisingly my picked seat gone, and i need to re-pick my seat. By doing that, i will be charged with extra fee. So my question to AA is that i&#39;m not the one intended to make a change, but it is AA made the change so why i&#39;m the one need to pay an extra fee? Regrettably until today i couldnt get their respond on this!"
1,Website sucks,Website sucks. Customer care didn&#39;t even try to solve anything.
1,"Extortion on extra bags, poor customer service",Extortion on extra bags. $80 fee for one checked bag for a flight of roughly same price. Never mentioned in email that I needed to do something ahead of time. Rude customer service that kept telling me to &#8220;calm down&#8221; even though I was speaking in normal volume. Also bears mention that queue was incredibly long and service was slow. Avoid Air Asia.
1,Customer Support DOES NOT EXIST,"There is literally no such thing as Live Chat customer support. The moment you log in, it instantly stops being an option.<br /><br />I&#39;ve had countless experiences with airasia where the moment you buy a ticket, they would avoid all customer interaction and make it virtually impossible for you to contact them."
1,I have booked Air Asia flight from&#8230;Mumbai to Sydney via Kuala Lampur,"I have booked Air Asia flight from Mumbai to Syd and did not book additional baggage to check in on both legs of the journey but only one. When I contacted Customer care a day before departure I was told I could pay at the counter before boarding <br />the flight.<br />However, staff at Mumbai airport (manager Anish and team) were harsh, rude and insensitive to my situation by denying any mode of payment and were demanding only cash. Me being NRI did not carry any INR and had limited AUD with me that I wanted to use for inflight meals etc.<br />However, they were very demanding and rude and gone to the extent of sneaking into my purse and persuade me to exchange my AUD into INR right at the airport to pay them in cash. This is worst professionalism you can display in any industry.<br />When I resisted they ordered my baggage to be removed and board another flight which is not just against Air Asia business model and customer service but against any level of humanity.<br />After one hour of argument and losing my energy ending up with sore throat they have accepted my card payment.<br />This was all not before I realised i am running late and in danger of missing my flight.<br />They may boast about most affordable airlines but I strongly advice any traveller not to fall into the trap of cheap air tickets by Air Asia and avoid being ripped off with appalling service and ridiculous staff."
1,Rude ground staff - never use Air Asia again,"Rude ground staff, especially in Malaysia. And the most cramped seats I&#39;ve ever seen..  Next time I&#39;ll definitely pay extra and fly with a more respected airline"
3,They used to be good,"They used to be good, plenty of destinations and good deals. But lately they have started to charge extra for everything and the limitation of 7 kg for hand luggage is total nonsense..."
1,UNPROFESSIONAL WORST EXPERIANCE EVER,"Buggy website loads time wasted time wasted getting nowhere. Was due a refund, never paid out as I changed bank accounts after I bought ticked tried to refund to old account was returned to them. I guess they don&#39;t believe me and think I&#39;m trying to scam them. Sent queries and never get a response. Closed complaint prematurely. Worst experiance ever with them. They say you will hear from us shortly and never do.<br />PLEASE AVOID NOT A PROFESSIONAL COMPANY."
1,The worst imaginable customer service,The worst imaginable customer service. Doesn&#39;t deserve even 1 star.
1,Has to be the worst customer service I&#8230;,Has to be the worst customer service I have come across.  Our flight which was only a 50 min one from Kalibo to Manila was delayed by 8 hours.  Had an email early in the morning warning me of the delay saying that it was due to Kalibo airport being closed. As we were staying right across the road from the airport we went over to have a look and the airport was functionally normal.  Since coming home I have been in contact with their so called customer service on a number of times asking for an explanation but just get fobbed off. I even had a delay and 1 hr guarantee insurance with them but it is a mind field trying to claim off it as they want so many different documentation.
1,The support is a scam,"The support is a scam. I tried to reset my password. I had to complete their e-form at least three times, and still no satisfaction.<br /><br />They claim that they have no trace of any previous emails and no trace of any previous eform.<br /><br />Hopeless."
1,Buggy website and Indecent After-Sales Service,"Their buggy website changed my flight month.<br /><br />Was supposed to be 6th of Feb 2018, got an itinerary on 6th of March 2018 instead.<br /><br />They say they will investigate it and it needs 2 days to work on it (success = change travel date for free), whereas there&#39;s no assurance on the possibility of success in the appeal.<br /><br />It is now 3rd of Feb 2018 and in the end I have to pay a penalty in order to change the travel date.<br /><br />Oh and they also said, if I were to change the travel date by my own. The appeal is going to be dismissed."
1,Paid twice to get a window seat,"On July 3 (2017), I reserved and paid for a window seat for a flight from Cebu City to Taipei. Later, I was advised that the flight was postponed for the day after.  In January 2018, I tried to do get my boarding pass as it has to be done over the internet. Surprise! My seat wasn&#39;t anymore on a window seat.  Without warning about extra fee I moved it to a window seat in the same area. Suddenly, I could not properly get my boarding pass without paying an extra fee for that window seat.<br /><br />- I sent 3  e-mails about the situation. First one, I had to pay then no reply from the others. <br /><br />----------<br />3 times I wait an average 1 hour to get the &quot;chat&quot; service. <br /><br />They all agree that something was wrong but nothing had been done.<br /><br /><br />----------<br /><br />At the airport, I had to pay for that seat to get my boarding pass.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />On a positive note, Air Asia is a very inexpensive airliner."
1,On Live chat,"On Live chat, queue number dwindles suddenly to a different number suddenly. I was waiting for around 30 mins from queue number 45 to when i  was on Number 7, the queue number suddenly went to 31?! I was totally frustrated on how such a thing can happen. Worst service!"
1,The worse experiences i have had have been with AirAsia,"The worse experiences i have had have been air asia. The only time i travel with them is when no other flights for the destination/ time required. and they all have been quite disastrous. Today i found out they have the worse customer support too - No hotline number other than Air Asia X, queue for 45 min to be on online chat. Before the problems are properly resolved, they will automatically disconnect and close your online chat. You are logged out and cant even read the chat history. Im definitely putting more efforts to go to places when there are other airlines available."
1,Bad service,"Bad service, very unreasonable company that is not providing any help when you need it. <br /><br />Wo"
1,USELESS CUSTOMER SERVICE,"We had a flight booked with AirAsia and we found out, afterwards, that there was supposed to be an hurricane in those days and we contacted the customer service to find out if our cover was enough to have the flight refunded in case the flight was going to be cancelled or if we need to get a different one.<br />It took them DAYS to reply asking for info that were already clearly stated in our initial email to them.<br />They were obviously trying to waste our time. In the end by the time they got back to us, we were already at our destination.<br />Completely USELESS!!!!"
1,AirAsia robbed us,"AirAsia robbed us<br />They charged us $1,934 for excess baggage which was by their system error. We requested them to verify it many times but nothing happened.<br />We requested Qld Fair Trading and ACCC, the answer &quot;they can not force the trader to refund.<br />We need to attend to QCAT but we are not curtain about their address in Australia.<br />As per they overcharged $60 Airport tax for kids under 12 for 7 years and ACCC do nothing just let them refund. Is this correct? Even if AirAsia overcharged for just a year. The matter should be verify / investigate if it is a robbery? But this had been charged for 7 years. How AirAsia responded that they were incorrectly charged.<br />We also inquired to Department of Immigration and Boarder Security, if AirAsia repaid the Airport tax (Passenger Movement Charge) since the first year they did charge people. And if they paid to the Department correctly since the first year. How come they did not know that it was an error? We wish that there would be some organization investigate this matter."
5,good and cheap,Many destinations for cheap. Best airlines for avid travelers with small budget. They ar really good!!!
2,I traveled on flight number I5-1427 &#8230;,"I traveled on flight number I5-1427 from Jaipur to Pune on 23rd November, 2017 and the flight was unduly delayed by 3 hours. I had to unnecessarily miss my bus from Pune to Goa, which cost me INR 1,200 + the hassles. Uncalled for, unprofessional and very irritating!"
5,highly recommended!,"i travel with air asia regularly (especially the kuala lumpur - sydney route), services were great, it is a budget airline so comfort is not an issue to me (i got what i paid for), highly recommended!"
1,e-gift voucher takes 7 days to arrive VIA email. Support not responsive.,e-gift voucher takes 7 days to arrive VIA EMAIL. This is not mentioned on their website or the e-gift terms and conditions. Telephone support atrocious.<br />email/web form support is non-existent. My ticket opened two days ago has not been responded to. Web chat service: takes hours to connect to agent. You start at queue number 80 sometimes.<br /><br />Update 21/11/17: Support has eventually come back and said where it&#39;s mentioned on their GB website. I&#39;m pretty sure it wasn&#39;t mentioned on the website I used when purchasing the E-Gift voucher. In any case the writing is in small print.
1,worthless policies  and  they know it,if you like  paying  50 euro  for  them to print  the boarding pass  because  they dont accept  it from your phone like everyone else <br />or  if you like clicking  No to all the addons two  times  and  they  try to flip all of  your NO  to a yes  later on in the booking process<br />go for it  great company
4,Trusty &amp; Good prices,"Trusty &amp; Good prices<br />I travel quite often with AirAsia to Australia &amp; Thailand, never any difficulties and always ok price."
1,Pathetic experience with Air Asia,"Pathetic experience with Air Asia<br /><br />I bought an Air Asia ticket for 112 euros for my future wife, from Puerto Princesa (Palawan) to Manila. Given to the usual but still acceptable delays of these company, I had taken a flight on September 1St at 8:50 am to allow her to take her intercontinental Emirates flight from Manila to France at 6:40 am on September 2 with serenity.<br /><br />August 31 at 4:30 pm in the late eve of her travel, I got first a mail from Air Asia saying:<br /><br />« We regret to inform you that flight Z2-433 which is scheduled to start from Puerto Princesa to Manila on August 01, 2017 at 08:50 AM (08:50:00) has been cancelled due to Additional Servicing of the Assigned Aircraft.<br /><br />Your NEW Flight Details:<br /><br />Flight Number&#9;Z2-421<br />Departure PPS&#9;7:40 PM (1940 (H), local time<br />Happens MNL&#9;9:10 PM (2110H), local time<br /><br />For assistance, you may choose one of the following service recovery options:<br />1. One time free move flight within 30 days. <br />2. Convert fare amount to credit shell valid for 90 days.<br />3. Refund.<br />Etc.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />AirAsia.<br /><br />At 16:32 pm, I received a SMS of Air Asia, telling me: <br /><br />« Dear Valued Guest, PNR SJ2KJJ with flight Z2-433 PPS - MNL on 01 Aug 2017 has been cancelled and moved to Z2-421 NETD 7:40 PM (1940 H).» For your flight assistance, kindly call + 632-722-2742, 6 am - 11 pm, or check your registered email for more information. »<br /><br />The expression &#8220;NETD&#8221; made these SMS particularly incomprehensible. I didn&#39;t know if she could catch a plane at 7:40 pm on September 1St, or only on September 2. In the first case, I also could not take the risk, because the company could delay the flight until the next morning, since she is often late. So I had to take in emergency a Philippine Airlines ticket for 95 euros.<br /><br />Based on the mail, I therefore asked the refund on the website of the company and sent all requested files. By mail from August 2, the company asked me the same thing, what I did on August 4. I did send a reminder on August 9 and 18. I got a generic acknowledgement of receipt on August 19, telling me that the refund was in process. Then nothing more. I recalled September 5 : no response anymore.<br /><br />When my future wife came back to Manila, as the Schengen appointment at the French Embassy had been advanced, she asked Air Asia if she could change her flight paying a supplement. Answer : No. So she took a flight on Cebu Airlines.<br /><br />In conclusion:<br /><br />This company does not respect the usual basic commitments of the profession. Legitimate refunds are not made (that of the flight from Puerto to Manila). Finally, I paid the equivalent of 207 euros for a so-called &#8220;low cost company&#8221;, which did not honor the flight Puerto-Manila, while I paid 211 euros for my next flight in December from Manila to Puerto -and back- on Philippine Airlines.<br />Actually, on this flight, the Air Asia company has proved to be twice as expensive as Philippine Airlines.<br /><br />My advice: <br /><br />Don&#39;t take this company, which is not reliable about schedules or contractual terms. You will lose your money, not to mention the serious incidents that have affected her in recent months.<br />For your travels in Asia you better offer yourself the serenity that will give you the financial and contractual reliability and good board service of other companies."
5,Fantastic airline,"Fantastic airline, we have flown with them over 20 times in the last 3 years. we only suffered 1 delay in all the flights.<br />Out of all the staff we dealt with we only had one bad experience with a desk agent who was having a bad day."
1,never ever buy anything from them,"never ever buy anything from them. if for some reason (usually their fault) and you want to request for a refund, that money never comes back. they will just ignore your claim without any explanation."
1,Air Asia BIG is a BIG marketing stunt with no reality,"Dear All,<br /><br />Please beware that the Big Loyalty program is a marketing stunt with no reality behind, I always book attaching my Big ID, however no points are awarded. <br /><br />I then fill the form to claim mails, I get an auto reply - as this: <br />&quot;Thanks for contacting AirAsia BIG. We will get in touch with you shortly&quot;<br />and that is the last you hear of that... even you remind them... <br /><br />Just don&#39;t waste your time on this marketing stunt..."
1,Staged &quot;bug&quot; when clicking &#39;No I do not want the insurance&#39;.,"There is an option to click &quot;I do not want the insurance&quot; when booking a flight on the Air Asia Malaysia website, but everytime you choose not to buy the insurance the website breaks down claiming that &quot;it is a bug&quot;. I have tried it about 20 times having to re-do the whole process every time. However when you choose to buy the insurance you slip through without problems. <br /><br />Since this is clearly an unlawful scam by AirAsia Malaysia I will document the matter with hopes that their wrongdoings will be penalized."
1,One of the worst websites ever,"One of the worst websites ever, can&#39;t even book my flight, also charge a fee for using credit card. No thanks"
1,They will throw away your luggage!,STAY AWAY! <br /><br />Airasia is a lousy company! They lost our bag and after a month I was told that it was still in Kuala Lumpur airport!<br /><br />And they refuse to ship it to me! Highly incompitent! Why am I supposed to go to Kuala Lumpur to claim my bag when YOU lost it! I live in Copenhagen!<br /><br />I&#39;m never going to use this Company again!
1,Worst,AirAsia MNL. Booked a flight for my Mom. Checked in via web. The only problem I acknowledge was our fault was we didn&#39;t have the printout of the boarding pass. My mom asked the lady at the counter to printout a boarding pass and she should be on her way. They said NO. Because it&#39;s already boarding. And said to rebook another flight. My mom inisisted she ONLY needed a boarding pass - no one from your team cared. Took them 15 mins then they announced  her name for LAST CALL!!! HOW THE **** WAS IT TOO LATE TO GET A BOARDING PASS when they called her name????? Never flying with you again
1,Please do us all a favour and shut this airline down!.,"Air Asia is expanding too fast to take control of the people who work for that airline. I totally agree when Air Asia customers say that Tony Fernandes (CEO) should take care more about his stuff members than expanding more and more. Actually you should shut down this airline!!! <br />I booked a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Auckland for 2 persons + sports equipment. On the check-in counter they refused me to go on that flight, as they considered my PASSPORT as damaged. My PASSPORT detail page has a torn on the top page which is not too big. <br />It is still intakt, no photo damage, no detail damage, you are able to scan...<br />But the stuff on the check-in counter from Air Asia has been really naughty, she send me to the Service Counter. At the Service Counter the stuff member were all overchallenged as other people were standing there to complain. All the stuff members just could say &quot;you cannot fly, your PASSPORT is consider damage&quot;! Thats all? Are you kidding me? <br />They were sending me to one manager at another counter and i was talking to him. I have been telling all of them that since i travel i never had any issues. But this manager didnt care and said the same like the others with a really rude attitude. They dont give any other explanations, they just dont care and they treat you so bad! They way how the manager and stuff member talk to you is super rude and naughty!!! <br />As Air Asia is a low fare Airline i think they dont give a #### how to treat people. How is this even acceptable??? Why do they treat customers in the way they do? What gives them the right? For me, its all out of reason. <br />They way they treat you makes you angry, aggressive and you are in the situation to fight because of their manner/attitude.<br /><br />I have been traveling to Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, India, Nepal and back to Malaysia without any problems with my PASSPORT and the torn on the detail page. No one of the Customs or even Immigration of each country has mentioned anything about it. Plus...In my opinion, the Immigration or Customs could easily let you know if your PASSPORT is considered as damage. <br />What do you do with your PASSPORT? You hand it over every single time you enter a country. The people on the Immigration have a close look on it, scan your PASSPORT and flip through. Also in hotels your PASSPORT get used for scanning. Of course if you travel a lot, your PASSPORT get wear and tear. So you should actually get a notice from the Airline or from the Immigration that your PASSPORT has a torn. BUT NOT A REFUSE to get on the flight. Why do they refuse you? Because they are afraid to pay a fine when it comes to the Immigration in the other country. <br />Of course they dont want to pay a fine, Air Asia just want to soak up your money because you dont get a refund back, its your ####ing problem of the PASSPORT. Seriously?<br /><br />After some research i have found out there are existing more bad reviews than good ones. <br />NEVER EVER AGAIN! <br />I do like to travel budget but there is no reason to treat customers like that. Surely in future, i will pay more for my flights but have an EXCELLENT SERVICE."
2,A slight hiccup with your booking lead to downward spiral of ridiculousness,"The most recent bad experience I had with this company is booking my ticket for KUL-KIX. Initially, I booked the Premium Flatbed with promo price. Some weeks later I received email regarding the flight reschedule and asked me to choose either re-schedule to another date or receive credit shell. I submitted form to INQUIRE about the credit shell and then I ended up having my booking canceled and refunded in credit voucher form. I submitted another form to get the booking reinstated but then I lost my Premium Flatbed. I requested back and forth to have it reinstated back to the original service class but they insisted on saying flatbed seats are limited and not available. Till now I still struggling on claiming back the service class that I originally paid for while my travel date is nearing. If they don&#39;t resolve this issue, I have to pay extra for the luggage allowance and meal. I felt cheated and scammed. You can only live chat over the web with their customer service reps and most of the time they will end up telling you to submit eForm which feuling your vicious cycle of despair."
1,Horrible customer treatment!,"The worst airline ever. Their services are very unclear and confusing, you can&#39;t get corect and reliable info easily. Their customer support is HORRIBLE,  i tried contacting them several times on live chat (waiting times always 1+ hr) but it would always cut me off before i got my turn. I tried calling several tines too and when i finally got an agent on the phone, not only did he barely speak english, he seemed very stupid and didn&#39;t help me at all in the 20 minutes i was on the line trying to explain my problem. Not worth the trouble!"
1,Cancelled flight then rescheduled 2nd,1st flight I booked got cancelled 2nd got re scheduled from 13:35 to 18:00 .... Absolute joke of a airline will never choose them again. My flight with a cheaper airline that was 3 times cheaper was better service than Air Asia.   Avoid if you do not enjoy hassle.
5,There are very good and usually ver cheap,I lived during 2 years in Singapore and I was using Air Asia many times when travelling to the neighboor countries during weekends. <br /><br />They have many flight and many routes and you can get very good rates if you book in advance.
1,Check in system is total SUCKS!,"Check in system is total SUCKS! I booked for me and my son, after self checked in, we had different seat number. My son is 9. On board i asked if i can have a seat with my son. But flight attendant cannot find 2 seat which can trade with ours so i can sit with my son. <br />Self Check in are really sucks. Doesnt make any sense if you book a flight for 2 sets then got different seat after check in using self check in. FIX THAT! Fight number QZ7557 (jogja-jakarta)"
1,Budget doesn&#39;t have to mean poor customer service,"I am sure your company has heard of the term &quot;time is money.&quot; I do not know about your business practice but MY TIME is incredibly valuable. Such lack of respect for my time and that of the other passengers in EVERY SINGLE flight I was on is beyond words. Not a single flight of the 5 I took with your airline was on time, at the contrary, every one of these was severely delayed. <br /><br />And seriously, you are so cheap you cannot even offer free water to your customers? <br /><br />Lastly,  you have this &quot;duty free shopping&quot; inflghtt option, only to see all of the carts nearly empty. Every single item I was after was not available and had not been available for a very long time according to your air hostess.<br /><br />Airlines have become so disgustingly greedy. They forget WHO they serve. WHY they exist. If it weren&#39;t for customers, they would not be in business."
2,It is low cost - you get low cost!,"The airline that gets Asia moving. Truly low cost. Expect large queues, unfriendly staff, enormous flight delays, and no customer service whatsoever. If your budget allows alternatives, use them. Many much better low cost carriers are operating in the region. On the other hand, the website and booking process is seamless and top user friendly."
1,Avoid if you can and dont buy their travel insurance if you travel,"Our flight took off basically before we bought our tickets (3h earlier from the scheduled time). How can this even be possible? If you are about to take off-stop selling the tickets!!! Even though we had provided all necessary contact information, such as, emails, local mobile number, we&#39;ve got to know about this early departure after our arrival to the airport. That&#39;s insane!<br />They&#39;ve of course replaced our tickets, but it was to the next days flight.  Even though tickets were at least twice cheaper, difference was not covered. We had to stay in a dirty overpriced hotel to overnight instead of staying in a nice with an ocean view hotel booked for the same night for the same price in another island. It ruined our vacation plans. <br />For the hotel we had to pay by ourselves and lucky we that we could afford that. Since there was another guy whom we meet on hour way. He had to sleep in the airport as he couldn&#39;t afford paying for two hotels a night.<br />Together with flight tickets we bought their &quot;Tune Protect Travel Insurance by Airasia&quot; which suppose to represent us in situation like this and to cover our expenses. However expenses are not covered yet. <br />So it doesn&#39;t represent us, but it does represent Airasia."
1,FRAUD !!!!!,"I have traveled quite a lot with Air Asia, THIS time though, we ordered on a wrong date, we went to Air Asia in Yangoon Airport to book new tickets and ask about the old ones, Air Asia specificly told us that we could get a 100% refund on Luggage, and Airport Tax, but we had to apply on the homepage.<br />That we thought was on, at that point, 4 times 25$ Tax + 68$ Luggage<br />We went to the homepage, and found out that there were NO contact E-mail to be found ANYWHERE........<br />But there were a form to fill out, we checked that we meet all the criterias, But EVERYTIME we applied for the 165$ we got an automated (none replyable) mail saying we did NOT meet the criterias, <br />We applied 4 times with same result, and as theres no office for Air Asia in Denmark, looks like we have no way of getting our money back.... I think this is the worst service EVER !!!! Totally FRAUD !!!"
5,Really rate this airline,I am based in South East Asia and rely on this great low cost airline to get me around .Great staff and i have never had any issues with delays .Happy to be a Big Shot! Loyalty programme could have more to offer but the prices are low and the quality high so cant complain.
1,Delay upon delay upon delay,"I had a horrible experience travelling from manila to Puerto Princesa and back, flying with AirAsia. Both ways were delayed over 2 hours, which meant that I almost did not make my connecting flight in Manila, flying from Puerto Princesa. The staff are simply unprofessional, they do not give any information of the delay before the estimated departure time has passed (which prevents you from purchasing a new ticket from another Company). Instead they spend their time in the check in area, i counted 21 people behind 2  desk doing absolutely NOTHING. <br /><br />DO NOT BUY A TICKET FROM THEM, I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL REGRET IT"
1,Worst costumer service ever...,They just leave the chat when I ask a question... Haven&#39;t got a respond on my email even though it has been two months now and I even got an email back saying they&#39;ve received my request.... No answer at all... NEVER again...
5,Super service - Twice,"1. Air Asia changed the flight time for our flight from morning till afternoon. We needed to arrive in the morning.<br />After 5 minutes chat our flight time where changed to the evening before. It cost us one night at hotel, but that&#39;s OK. We will be in time for our trip.<br /><br />2. I bought a ticket to Air Asia from another company, but The ticket never got visible at Air Asia&#39;s homepage in the member section, and it wasn&#39;t possible to modify the ticket for one of the travelers.<br />An e-mail to Air Asia and 3 days later. The booking was mapped to my member ID and my e-mail, and I was able to modify the booking for the traveler.<br /><br />It can&#39;t be better<br /><br />Thank you for your kind help<br /><br />In the future, I&#39;ll make sure to buy my ticket directly from Air Asia"
1,Shocking,"Website is a mess doesn&#39;t work, add ons i didn&#39;t ask for &amp; couldn&#39;t remove.  I gave up what a useless website."
3,Just an okay budget airline,"Price wise they&#39;re quite cheap compared to the other airlines. Have experienced quite a few delays. The flight attendants are... okay... not super professional but acceptable. The planes are nice, the food is okay. Would fly with them again but i prefer Garuda."
1,Unprofessional check in tactics by AirAsia,I arrived in KLIA terminal two for a check in at AirAsia domestic flight.<br /><br />There was only 7 passengers in front of me and I was over 120 minutes before departure time.<br /><br />It took the check in desk more than 70 minutes to process the 7 passenger and I was told I was too late for my flight.<br /><br />I had no check in luggage.<br /><br />I was made to pay a penalty to transfer to a later flight and upon entering the departure lounge the initial flight I was supposed to take was delayed by over 1 hour!<br /><br />I wrote to AirAsia customer service to express the injustice that AirAsia can actually profited from imposing penalty on passengers who arrive to the check desk in good time and cannot be checked in due to AirAsia&#39;s incompetency of having just one check in desk for multiple flight (which is a wholly unethical win-win arrangement for AirAsia).<br /><br />I then received a generic really by AirAsia indicating that all passengers are required to check in 2 hours before flight time. <br /><br />Am I expected to arrive to the check in desk and start a scene then?<br /><br />This is a business trip for me and the potential loss of my business trading as well as the lack of professional etiquette of AirAsia is enough to persuade never to use them again.<br /><br />Please do not use AirAsia. The only way they will learn decent customer care is via loss of earning. They do not pay attention to feedbacks and from this trust pilot I learnt I am not the only victim.
1,Incredibly BAD,"They cancelled our flight 3 hours before it was due to depart and rescheduled it for 16 hours later. We had to spend the day and night at the airport and the airline refused to provide accommodation. Worst part is trying to contact the customer service for compensation has been a nightmare. They just refuse to reply. I waited 2 hours in a queue on their live chat, but when I got to number 1 in the queue, it failed to progress. My guess is the live chat doesn&#39;t even work.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t a one off incident, you only have to look at the departure boards at the airports to see delays and cancellations are regular occurrences at this airport. BE WARNED, IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK!"
4,Strong 4 stars,"It has been happend I am travaling around 1 year all over Asia region. Of course I use Airasia. It is cheap, fast and affordable almost for everyone. Of course it is not a business class, but you pay more less than in other air agents. I am pretty high man and some times I feel uncomfortable in chairs because of little spaces for my legs. But the main plus is the price. It is cheap and almost every time I could buy tickets it is always free seats there. Of course if I fly on a long trip like more than flying 4-5 hours  i will chose more comfortable company, but if my flight is round 2-3 hours i definitely choose airasia. Thanks guys for affordable prices."
1,Would rather leave you stranded,"This is a company that 100% does not care about the customer.<br /><br />Flying from Hong Kong to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur I had a short changeover. I tried to get them to put my bags through, this could not be done because they were technically separate bookings, somewhat understandable but really not that hard to work around, even if they charge a fee.<br /><br />The flight was delayed, not long, only about 20 minutes, but enough to make me miss my next flight as I had to go through immigration, a painfully slow AirAsia special baggage claim and customs.<br /><br />I asked 2 different AirAsia people in the baggage area to please notify upstairs that I&#39;m on my way and will be there very soon. They didn&#39;t, didn&#39;t really want to. (By the way, this is a pretty normal request, not way far out).<br /><br />I got to the desk about 45 minutes before departure, right when the cut off time is, but it had already been closed.<br /><br />The people were amazingly unhelpful telling me to go to about 4 different desks then finally I got to talk to someone. I was told that I had to page 435 Australian dollars or 330 USD (which is about 80USD more than the whole original booking) to get on the next night. Despite it being their delay and slow staff that stopped me getting onto another AirAsia flight.<br /><br />When I told the &quot;customer service&quot; man about how that is ridiculous he was crying that I booked through another website that is really screwing over AirAsia so I don&#39;t get any benefit like that. I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;re more than happy for these companies to sell tickets on your behalf, if you aren&#39;t, DON&#39;T SELL THROUGH THEM, or if you aren&#39;t happy with the price you get from them, DON&#39;T ALLOW THEM TO SELL THEM CHEAPLY. Don&#39;t just take the money and then cry victim to the customer when you can&#39;t actually deliver your service.<br /><br />Any half decent airline would try to work to get me somewhere to stay and some food vouchers, AirAsia had no interest in either simply because the money they got from me wasn&#39;t booked through their bad website (and it is bad, I couldn&#39;t fix my booking through them at all as they didn&#39;t have it). The &quot;customer service&quot; person was not even willing to help me find a hotel beyond it&#39;s down the road 5 minutes and had no idea about the airport he worked in, unsure where lockers were or where I could put bags away.<br /><br />And they flight they should&#39;ve just put me on for free was half empty too, it&#39;s not like I was taking up space, they just wanted to charge me because they couldn&#39;t get me to where my ticket said the first time.<br /><br />Pathetic customer service, pathetic company. They would honestly rather leave me stranded if it meant they couldn&#39;t take advantage of me in a situation that they put me in. I asked the man if he could waive the fees but apparently the computer wouldn&#39;t allow that. What kind of company doesn&#39;t give any control to the people on the ground dealing with the customers? Not a customer service one, that&#39;s for sure.<br /><br />AirAsia got $435 more out of me but they&#39;ll lose more from me alone as I&#39;ll never fly with them ever again, nor will my family and I will happily warn anyone who mentions flying to Asia about this company, it would be mean for me not to."
1,Unbelievable lack of sympathy,"We were on holiday in Thailand when my wife was called to say her mother had died.  I needed us all back quickly to get to the funeral and had to abandon the holiday.  My wife and daughter had flown with AirAsia through Singapore.  I had to completely book new tickets as they would only allow me to &#39;make a claim&#39; for a refund on passionate grounds and not simply change the return dates (which should have been quite simple).  I have tried to seek the refund for almost a year now, after providing death certificates, and other evidence.  Despite having submitted emails and documents at least a dozen times I keep getting the same answer - no record of the claim and please file again with a weblink that does not exist.  Very tricky!  Make you try and file a claim with a dead link!  <br /><br />Fed up with their customer service - pathetic.  Will never use them again."
2,Cheap - and not only in the good way,"One have to acknowledge that Airasia flights are in many cases quite cheap. <br />But  the sales tricks are equally cheap and nasty - so when you first see a price expect to add 50-100% on top. Not only for seats, luggage, food. They also try to trick you into buying an issurance (which most travellers already have anyway). <br />But worst of all: when are to check out an USD 12 fee is added for you to pay for the ticket with you credit card. And if you are not Malaysian, you have no other way to pay (discriminatory?). I.e. USD 12 on top of a 30-50USD ticket! And it is not per order, which was perhaps understandable, however 4 tickets would be 48 USD. <br />So it can easily be more than 25% just to pay your ticket :-("
1,"Poor, slow and outdated","Out of all lowcosters I experienced, Airasia deserves the worst feedback. The only good thing is relatively clean and fresh jets. The rest is horrible: service is slow and stupid, we were served food 3 hrs after take-off!!! And it was a night flight.. <br />They don&#39;t event have a clue of how to organise the food ordering properly, flight attendants work individually with each passenger to take an order, accept payment, bring the change, put it on the list, etc. etc. It takes minutes to serve only one passenger!<br />The food is horrible. There is a nice brochure with photos, but reality bites: first of all, they run out of good meals almost immediately! All that remains is stupid malaysian fried rice and somethig else, and both of them are SPICY!! I specifically asked a flight attendant about that and I was told it won&#39;t be spicy, but it appeared to be! My daughter could not eat it. All in all, we ended up buying our own food for the flight on the way back.<br />One more thing: they do not even serve free drinking water!!!! That was outrageous!!<br />Finally, the entertainment devices (tablets) which are for rent, it&#39;s a very limited amount, and it looks like it was only for pre-orders. This does not make sense as they have a brochure which clearly states that I can rent it on the fly!!<br /><br />Look, I know that you can&#39;t expect much from the low-coster, but Airasia seems way too outdated compared to modern mechanisms and client service. They need to improve if they want to compete with normal companies."
1,cheap airlines  with cheap customer service,"Never ever travel with them always trying to get some money out . while travelling from hyd, india to dps,bali they did not issue a single pnr and made me lose money as we need a tranist visa in malaysia even thought the official website says otherwise. the rude manager could have helped us out by clubbing the tickets but he said he dint have to check or call anyone, its not his job to please customers and he has other things to do .the only thing he kept repeating was we are cheap airlines and we do not have to do anything if you wanted better service you should have opted for other airlines.  along with me there were 6 other people who lost their money and had to book other airlines .I hope your company shuts down and you lose your job.<br />took a video of it and the manager was threatening to stop the video recording ."
2,Don&#39;t ever buy the AirAsia ASEAN Pass,"It&#39;s money down the drain. You cannot book any of the promised flights even though you are out months in advance. <br /><br />Also, AirAsia has a company policy of never refunding."
1,"Warning! Extremely bad experience, forced to buy extra tickets by the airline!","The airline (Airasia) did not let us check in, even though we spent 2 hours in a queue to do so. When only 45 minutes were remaining until the flight were to departure (sign on desk said you have to check in 45 minutes before departure), I forced my way to the counter (getting ahead of many waiting people)and told the woman that she must help us right away. She answers me: to late, no checking in. She also tells me to go to one servicedesk to get help (only one open, with lots of people in a queue there to). Arriving the servicedesk, lots of angry people stand there with the same issue, not only regarding &quot;my flight&quot; but for some other flights to. All the people have the same problem, some different flights but with the same airline. I did not get in this line, I pushed my way to the counter right away and said: emergency! Help right now! Still there is 35-40 minutes before departure. Personal answers me: to late, no check in, buy new ticket for another flight.<br />I get angry and say that I can take my baggage as handbaggage and border the plane (you are allowed to border 20 minutes before departure). There is still time to make it.<br />Personal says no and then refuse to answer my comments and questions, ignoring me completaly. I now rais my voice and demand help and the need to talk to the chief. <br />The chief arrives after 10-15 minutes. He tells me to calm down, step aside and that there is no need to raise my voice. He tells me that me and my children are not getting on the plane no matter what I do, but that he can help me buy new tickets (without the previous PROMO-deal I had) for another plane. Also he tells me that I have to pay a penaltyfee , but maybe he can arrange this part to our favour. I tell him crying that the reason I bought PROMO-tickets with an lowcost airline was because I do not have money for any other option. I also say that we have been at the airport all night long, waiting for 2 hours in a line and we told people when check in closes that we had to get help despite of the long lines initially in front of us still. -Why should I have to pay new tickets? We were in time, asked people for help right away when time was ending and also were ready to rum to board the plane with our bags as handbaggage -even though we paid for baggage drop.<br />The man said they had called out to passengers for this flight to contact counter and check in many times. I was there for 2 hours and did not hear this. Two other people next to me also agreed to not getting this information, but the man said there was.  <br />Finally I was forced to buy new tickets (paying the same trip two times), after having to loan money. The man now also said he would ONLY charge me the penaltyfee, which meant that people in the same sitution got different deals for this problem. Finally he wanted me to be greatful that he &quot;helped me&quot;. I was humiliated, mistreated, ruined, standing with my two children at the airport in Kuala Lumpur....were we were to celebrate my sons survival of severe cancer, doing a trip with the money we had to loan to be able to afford...leaving with this experience."
1,Extremely bad service !!,My flight from Banda Ache to Kuala Lumpur (only 1 hour flight) was 3 hours delaid and no one got any kind of information about that before 10 minutes to the original boarding time.. as a result I missed my flight to Singapore from KL and didn&#39;t have the time to fix a new way to get to Singapore... There was no help at all from AirAsia in Banda Ache because they told me it was a delay caused by KL. In KL I went to the AirAsia counter and there I got the message that they couldn&#39;t help me with anything because I apperantly didn&#39;t buy their stupid extra insurance... So my choice was to either buy a new ticket myself or figure out another way to get to Singapore. I ended up going with the nighttrain - really cheap and realy nice! And I will never fly with AirAsia again... ever...
1,Bad booking system ever,"Things are fine till you try to change anything. I&#39;m fine with non-refundable booking. But the system don&#39;t allow you to see final payment till last page and there&#39;s no warning whatsoever that I&#39;ll be charged &#39;double&#39;. <br /><br />In the end, you end up being forced to accept the change even though you still haven&#39;t finished with the payment. It&#39;s unacceptable.<br /><br />And now my booking is screwed if I don&#39;t proceed with that payment, everything is gone. Take what little money I have Airasia but know that I&#39;ll never booked with you again and so does my family and everyone I can convinced. Never more."
5,everyone can fly,thanks to airasia as i can always fly with their exciting promo!
5,Great prices indeed,"I&#39;ve flown with air asia several times and all of my experiences were good. What you pay is really what you get in this case as there are extra charges for food, beverage, luggage, seating choice etc. Be smart when going about booking your flight, make sure you choose and pay for all the above add-ons in advance so you pay less. Even after all that, I still managed to save a ton which made travelling on a budget possible."
3,Gets you what you want but a long way round to get it!,"I Booked a flight from BKK to YGN return recently through the internet from here in the UK (I already have my flights booked to BKK from LHR)<br /><br />Although they are sponsoring Queens Park Rangers in the UK and Air Asia&#39;s owner is a truly international figurehead with interests in F1 as well, I was very surprised that although some prices are quoted in pounds, you can&#39;t actually pay in pounds when booking flights in another country. I paid in Thai Baht.<br /> I understand that the airline is low cost but at every step you seem to take adds more money on. For instance they add insurance on to the price even if you have your own, you actually have to untick the box and when the box comes up and asks whether you really want to cancel it you have to click &#39;cancel&#39; instead of ok. This was a little underhand if you ask me. <br />You also have to unclick the option to reserve an actual seat if you don&#39;t want one (they make money on pre-booked seats as well) rather than click on a seat if you want to reserve one.<br />Also it seems impossible to actually find an e-mail address to write to if you have an issue, and although there is a contact number to ring I never did actually get through to a real human being to speak to.<br />However the prices were very good and very competitive and once you&#39;ve worked out how the website works it&#39;s not impossible to book up. I have heard they are an excellent low cost airline and am looking forward to writing a review once I have tested their &#39;product&#39; next year..."
