1,Awful customer service,"Awful customer service. Never will I book with them again. No phone number to make a complaint, only an email address or online booking form. The response time, relating to a next day flight, is 48 hours! The phone number online, is only for reservations. Reservations can&#39;t deal with complaints. The online booking form never works, with constant error codes, like &#39;United Kingdom&#39; not recognised. They broke my suitcase. I had to buy another one. Do not book with this lazy airline. I won&#39;t be using them for business or personal travel again. Disgusting service with bad attitudes. The Supervisor told me today, we don&#39;t do good will gestures!"
1,Poor Service. 14 days later and my ticket still has not been changed.,"It has been a frustrating 2 weeks dealing with Malaysian Airlines. I&#39;ve been on the phone with them over the past 14 days to try and get my ticket changed from an am flight to a pm flight. <br />I was told once when i had called that they would call me back in 20 minute to confirm a booking. I waited from 3am-5am and never got a call back. It&#39;s the same process every time i try to call. They offer call backs or put your on very long holds that it&#39;s pointless waiting any longer.<br />To change my ticket I&#39;ve had to make an additional payment of $18 but because of issues on their end, the payment hasn&#39;t been able to go through.They said this was a common issue and they will resolve this with their team and call me back. I called them again 72 hours later and was told the ticket price has gone up and i would now have to pay $68 instead of $18. After a heated arguement, they offered to bring it down to $48, but because of the way their payment system is supposedly setup, they payment did not go through and i&#39;m back to square one where. I&#39;m unsure if this is every going to get resolved but i will not be flying Malaysian Airlines again."
3,Not getting back my money for refund&#8230;,Not getting back my money for refund after my flight got delayed and i&#39;ll never use same this flight company again. Cing cong cing cong
1,Probably one of the worst companies out&#8230;,"Probably one of the worst companies out there. So my flight got delayed over 24 hours, and I demanded a full credit refund or a free change of flight but the company refuses everything. Upon looking at my ticket which is shown I can get a full refund, every agent I speak to from the company just hangs up the phone. The agent I booked throigh trip.com is exactly the same. Avoid this scam company!"
2,I really wanted to give 5 stars but it all fell apart when we reached Heathrow.,"I really wanted to give 5 stars and was geared up to this right up until we arrived at Heathrow and found my luggage had not been loaded on the plane when we were in transit in Kuala Lumpur. <br />Our actual flights were faultless. The cabin staff were the most smiley, friendly and helpful we have experienced and the food was plentiful and good. Unfortunately a company&#39;s reputation is only as good as the weakest link in its operation and in this case its ability to actually put the luggage on the flight and the subcontractor in Heathrow who deals with three passengers who had the same problem.<br />In Heathrow one member of staff treated us with disinterest and said she had dealt with more than her fair share of customers and was not serving any more, leaving the painfully slow queue to the one remaining staff member who, she said, &quot;should speed up his work&quot;."
1,Terrible experience,"Hi There,<br /><br />I would like to send this complaint to the customer service department regards to my recent experience with your airline. I tried to send an email to the one it is available online but all of was rejected( wrong email addresses for customer service and your managers!!!)<br />My Husband and I were returning from Iran via Oman air and Malaysian airline on Sunday 28th of July on flight number : 141 and confirmation number: RATD6U for flight 9.10 am to Sydney.<br />When we arrived from Oman to Malaysia we visited the transfer desk for our checking card we were notified that we are not able to take our flight that we have booked it 2 month in advance and the reason was that airline over sold the tickets and whoever arrived earlier could take our seats and take the flight! ( never had this experience with other airlines.)<br /><br />My complaint is how can you sell my seats to someone else that I have booked and paid in advance?( you are hoping we do not show up???)<br />My husband and I are running two big businesses in Sydney and we have organised a few important meetings on Monday morning but unfortunately due to your staff decision we could not take the flight back home and it cost us so much damages because we could not be in Sydney on time.<br />*Who is going to cover my damages due to your overselling our seat to someone else?<br /><br />We asked the girls on transfer desk to ask the manager to come and explain this situation and guess what your duty manger ( MR Abdul Halim Zaki) did not care!, did not apologise and did not help us with any solution and in return he yelled at us and said he is not going to help us and we do not have any option and we have to wait another 14 hours in Malaysia to take another flight. He is such an unprofessional manager and did not care about customer problems and keep saying that it is not his problem and we do need to contact customer service. Can you please tell me why he is even there?<br />if he cannot do anything or if he is not responsible there?<br />He yelled at us and left the counter and left us with other girls that they did not know what they have to do with this situation (what a responsible and polite person you picked for your duty manager).<br /><br />We asked for any solutions but unfortunately no one was responsible for this problem, the flight left and we could not come back to Sydney on Sunday.<br />We asked the girls on the counter to at least make sure that our luggage does not get lost and please make sure that our luggage is sent on the same flight as us to Sydney, we visited transfer counter twice to make sure they have got all the details regards to our luggage, They assured us our luggage would be on the same flight both times.  and guess what??<br />One of our luggage did not arrive to Sydney with us and was still in Malaysia and the other one arrived badly damaged , the wheels are not working properly and lots of scratches on it even we have pre wrapped the luggage. (please check the attachments).<br />I bought my luggage recently and during this changed flight and cancelation my luggage was damaged badly.<br /><br /><br />Very disappointed with your airline and customer service in Malaysia. I think you need to change your Duty manger before makes more embracement for your brand."
1,Terrible website and service,"Terrible website, a disgrace for an airline. Website doesn&#39;t work under Chrome or Firefox, only internet explorer or edge ! is this a joke ?<br />Moreover somehow when you choose things in a drop down (destination, date, etc...), it has a tendancy to change by itself, this happened to me and they were not willing to do anything to help, just charged me 200 USD for changing the date &quot;as per our terms and conditions&quot;.<br />If you are willing to book an MH flight, do it through an agency website not their own !"
1,Never again,"It is more than 1 week that I send email to the global customer support to cancel and get a refund for 4 flights. I never received a reply from Malaysia Airline. Finally yesterday I decided to call them from overseas which cost a lot and the person told me that I will receive a confirmation email of the cancellation in 10 minutes time. So far 24 hours after, I never received any news ! Hopeless. Now one of my flight that I want to cancel is supposed to be tomorrow 1 June 2019 and I clearly hope that MAS will not play the game that they will not refund me this flight as I do not have a confirmation email from them. Because according to the ticket rules, when after departure first flight, it is not possible to get a refund. MAS do not care about the customer and I am exasperated by their casual attitude. I stop flying with them, I think it is better like this."
1,The world&#39;s worst airline,"The world&#39;s worst airline. If them managing to lose an airplane whilst it was mid-flight wasn&#39;t enough to put you off, then hopefully this review will.<br /><br />Malaysia Airlines overbooked our return flight back from KUL to LHR - we arrived to the airport a good two hours before the flight was due to depart, but were told it was overbooked and we were not permitted on (along with around 25 others) as we had not checked in online in advance. Having just come from Laos/Cambodia, we did not have the internet to do so.<br /><br />As a result, 25 of us were bumped on to the next flight, 12 hours later (consequently causing another 25 or so passengers from that flight to be told they were &#39;overbooked&#39;) and so on. Apparently, this is a practice Malaysia Airlines commonly do in order to ensure full flights and profit maximisation. Interestingly, it is only flights going back to Europe from SE Asia which are impacted, as customers have less protection there.<br /><br />We received NOTHING from the airline, despite it being entirely within their control. We also later found we were not protected by EU/UK regulations as we were out of EU airspace. <br /><br />The flights both ways were packed, check-in staff are rude and unfriendly and the air-stewardesses seem overworked and are grumpy, and irritated by the slightest thing. At one point, I asked for some more water and the stewardess looked as if she were about to implode.<br /><br />Having returned to the UK and sending over 20 emails, the most I could get back from them was a flight voucher for around £100pp which expired in four months time. <br /><br />It goes without saying, I will never fly with them again."
5,Have to say the service on this flight&#8230;,Have to say the service on this flight had to be the best we have encountered even though we were in economy. Not once did the air hostesses pull the curtains across the gallery like they do after food has been served as on so many long haul flights we have been on. The choice of films and music was excellent.<br />Food was excellent only complaint that the lighting it was so dim you could not read
4,Hope you guys will hear your customers&#8230;,Hope you guys will hear your customers for better service! I like your airlines but you have to improve lot of things
4,Pleasant experience on MH flights so far!,"Pleasant experience on MH flights so far. Although cabin crew can be more friendly, flight has been punctual and food tasty."
1,My trip with Malaysian Airline MH 705&#8230;,My trip with Malaysian Airline MH 705 started really bad it all began at drop off counter. My flight was from Manila to Oslo connecting flight in Kuala Lumpur and when i handle over my Passport (Swedish) i was asked for my ticket to Sweden. I answer that I&#39;m not going Sweden I work and live in Norway. Then the person behind desk reply ...then u have to show your working permit in Norway. I say i don&#39;t need to show this and have never ever done this in all years I&#39;ve been flying to Oslo from foreign countries that is not in EU. Then i told her that first Schengen country will be Netherlands and that i can move freely inside EU. She insisted that i need to show working permit or ticket from Oslo to Sweden. Tehn i ask her if she know where Sweden and Norway is located? She didn&#39;t know. I told her i can take the car to pass the boarder or even ferry if i want to and that Norway is a part of Schengen and its placed in Scandinavia north on the map. She still wouldn&#39;t give me my boarding pass and my patience was running out now and the que was getting longer behind me (business class only one counter)<br />Then i told her to call the supervisor i was really tired now on her no knowledge about EU/ESS. The supervisor came up and i got the same answer from her.....My god this is crazy i was think for myself...I&#39;m stranded in Manila because of the staff don&#39;t know better. Now i have been arguing about this issue for 30 min and now i told the Supervisor to call her boss which she did. After 35 min i got clearance to get my boarding pass.<br />How the heck can personal handling passenger at Malaysian Airlines not know better? This never ever happened to me before with other airlines when i fly from Manila or other countries (flying Manila 3 times a year) But its Malaysian Airlines fault not the person behind counter that should take the blame and the inconvenience i had at the counter.....time to improve Malaysian Airlines!!!!! Read and learn about the free movement in Schengen/EU!!
1,Terrible experience,"Terrible experience, booked in advance to come home from my first trip overseas. flight was delayed and I got numerous messages saying they had changed my flight. <br /><br />Then in Bangkok no one could tell me how they were getting me home and I was told i will have to stay in Kuala Lumpur overnight and when I asked if I was supposed to pay for this extra expense was told &#8220;yes you can complain&#8221; and that the attendants there might be able to help me. All I&#8217;m thinking is &#8220;hang on aren&#8217;t you all the one company&#8221;<br /><br />Moving forward they flew me to Kuala Lumpur and when I got there I went straight to the transfer counter so I could work out how they were getting me home. I asked &#8220;will my bags be okay well we organise this&#8221; and was told they have someone taking them to the baggage hold. I had already booked a non refundable hotel (because it was so last minute) and then was handed vouchers for transfers and hotel room, when asking why I wasn&#8217;t told this before they all looked at one another like this was common people being given the incorrect information. Things were starting to turn around though and I was happy with the new flight structure. So I left to go get my bags.<br /><br />The next disappointment- baggage claim! <br />I waited 45 minutes to be told they don&#8217;t actually have my bags and when asked why when the girl upstairs was on the phone why did she tell me they had my bag aside I was told &#8220;they shouldn&#8217;t have said that&#8221; again no communication and throwing other departments under the bus that run under the same company name. After FINALLY getting my bags which had been left by the conveyor belt i was told to go to where the transfer cars were and NOT told that because at this point it was 2:00am the transfers weren&#8217;t available, again waited where I was told. <br /><br />I finally made it to the hotel at 3am frustration was high and I was exhausted. I wouldn&#8217;t NEVER recommend Malaysia airlines to anyone and would NEVER fly with the company again. I work in customer service and if the person that is running this company think this is what you offer you are kidding yourself and have a long way to go to build a reputable company."
2,Booked a Malaysia Airlines codeshare&#8230;,Booked a Malaysia Airlines codeshare flight via Emirates from Manchester to Penang via Dubai and Kuala Lumpur. Original journey was supposed to be 20.5 hours total. Malaysia airlines cancelled the 11.15am flight and moved us to the 4:35pm flight. Adding 5 hours to our journey which will now be 25.5 hours. <br /><br />I contacted Emirates to ask if we could get accommodation or lounge access or meal tickets or something they said I would have to speak to Malaysia airlines because its their flight change. Malaysia Airlines said I have to speak to Emirates. Neither were willing to offer any kind of help.<br /><br />Moral of the story. Be careful when booking code share flights with connections. The code share airline can change the flight and you have no way to complain because you didn&#39;t book with them.
1,very poor online support,"I board MA on 29,  i tried to booked on website online, my internet speed is very good but website seem running on shared server, it was very slow, also your application is worst where no information how to book realtime. please hire some good web developer."
1,I flew with them years ago and found&#8230;,I flew with them years ago and found them good.. I have booked a one way flight from London to Auckland and want (cost me £450). Called to find out how much it is to add ONLY 10kg of baggage. Got a quote of £516!!! Surely a mistake?? Nope.. 3 phone calls later.. it is definitely £516. Trying to cancel ticket
1,i took flight QR5017 on 19/07 at 7.30pm&#8230;,"i took flight QR5017 on 19/07 at 7.30pm and flight delayed , we reached penang 8.45 , i need to transit flight from penang to Doha by qatar airway. Due to delay, qatar not allowed me to boarding, MAS arrange another flight and travel me to KLIA again and said we could boarding the flight 11pm to Doha, and mentioned crew staff will stand by at gate and give us boarding pass, unfortunately when i reached KLIA again ,i cant see no one in front of my gate , and i need to go around few different counter to ask my situation. i really upset and stress on that time, and the end i go to MAS ticketing counter and they said MAS arrange Emirates flight for me to go back to Birmingham, but i need to wait till 2am in the morning. it means i missed very important appointment because flight delayed. the worst things is my luggage was not travel with me, when i reached birmingham , i been waiting half an hour for my luggage . the crew staff told me my luggage still in KL, all my stuff is in my luggage, what could i said? i really disappointed with MAS service , due to flight delayed and i spend 25 hours for travelling my journey &#65292;somemore i am vegetarian, and i could not get meal during flight in Emirates as it need to book in advance, and i am still dont know where is my luggage now&#8230;"
1,Online check-in is useless,"The web check-in site and the app do not work, yet they insist on you printing your own boarding passes. I also couldn&#39;t book a seat reservation in advance because of an error on their end. Because of these issues I was forced to spend £30 on two phone calls to customer service, I had to call twice because the first person I spoke to didn&#39;t have a clue what they were doing.<br />To add insult to injury, once we checked our bags at the airport they printed out boarding passes for us at the gate, despite telling us to print our own, completely wasting my time and money and causing a great deal of stress and inconvenience which was all for nothing."
1,Very simple reason why I won&#39;t fly MAS&#8230;,Very simple reason why I won&#39;t fly MAS again: they unnecessarily split myself and my wife up into different seats in different rows. First and last time.
1,I would willingly pay more to fly with any other airline&#8230;,"I would willingly pay more to fly with any other airline rather than Malaysia.<br />A simple claim for lost luggage is now into month 4 and with no end in sight.<br />I am constantly chasing them up asking for updates by email, Twitter and Facebook. Absolutely no ownership, limited communication and little interest from them.<br />Sensing they hope that I will just be so frustrated by their lack of communication, that I will just not bother to pursue my claim for compensation.  Wrong!!!!"
1,I am not at all impressed with Malaysia&#8230;,"I am not at all impressed with Malaysia Airlines, having travelled Business Class from Europe to Thailand recently. The toilets were disgusting and there was no WIFI on a 11 hour flight ??? I think even their staff have given up. BTW: the crew smoke in the cockpit as was confirmed by cabin crew. From now on, I choose Emirates or Thai Airways. Don´t even think about using this airline. I dread to think what economy is like..."
1,Filthy toilets in Business Class Malaysian Airlines have lost the plot!,"Malaysia Airlines have completely lost the plot, with no stability at management level the lost recently of yet another CEO and the complete lack of strategy, is having a profound effect across all of its services.<br /><br />My recent journey from London to Kuala Lumpur on their ageing A380-800 highlighted their flaws and incompetence. Travelling business class and using their Business/First lounge which has not been fit-for-purpose for a decade or more. The Golden Lounge at Heathrow airport which has been in its current form to my knowledge for at least 20 years<br /><br />Decrepitated, out dated , fuddy-duddy, conceived before the age of the Internet is deficient in the extreme.<br /><br />Every aspect of this airline is outdated and dysfunctional. Starting with its booking process online with a website that does not contain many of the features of their competitors or any online travel business. Try reserving your seats online, in fact try finding any reference to seats on their website.<br /><br />Don&#8217;t even search for Wi-Fi, because there is none. Not on any aircraft that they operate. Every competitor of Malaysian Airlines offers Wi-Fi, in particular in business class. Malaysia have been aware of this deficiency since at least 2015 and have yet to implement this very basic business need across their fleet.<br /><br />Multi adapter charing sockets in lounges and onboard, do mot exist. It is as if, the entire information age has passed Malaysian Airlines by.<br /><br />The interior of the aircraft in business class on this particular journey was very tired, filth between the seats. In-flight entertainment that hasn&#8217;t structurally changed for 10 years, some of the entertainment itself hasn&#8217;t been changed at all . The toilets were appalling, not clean.<br /><br />Furthermore, an inability to hold a connecting Malaysian Airlines flight from Kuala Lumpur to Phuket, Scheduling it&#8217;s departure one hour before the arrival of the long haul inbound flight.<br /><br />Necessitating the passengers to stay overnight at the airport for the first connection in the morning. This is gross mismanagement incompetence of planning, in the extreme.<br /><br />Having lost two aircraft they still continue to fly over Ukraine and other conflict zones.<br /><br />#MalaysianAirlines #MH380 #Enrich #MH17 #Emirates #QatarAirways #ThaiAirways<br />#EmbarrassmenttoMalaysia #LetsGuide #MAS"
1,Missing baggage from Vietnam,"4 of us flew back recently from Vietnam via KL, Mumbai to Goa and whilst the flights and staff are ok their customer &quot;service?&quot; is dreadful ! They lost our suitcases ( something we had an jnkling at as the check in person at H.C.M was an idiot ) for 3 days.We were shuffled through immigration at Mumbai ( much to the annoyance of other passengers) and made to run to the connecting gate without our luggage( this was obviously pre planned due to them knowing of our missing  luggage) as &quot;we would miss our flight&quot;  once there we waited for an hour for the connection ! We the had to retrieve the luggage once found at our own cost from Dabolim airport.The labels showed it had been flown via Air India and not our onward carriers Jet Airways<br />We logged a complaint to which they replied and wrongly cited we are domicile in Goa and therefore no recompense woud be afforded ( which we are not, we are UK domicile) I/we pointed this out and gave them 48 hrs to respond this was 2 weeks ago ! No reply was received- an utter disgrace for a large airline"
1,Their website is a scam,"Although on their website- via manage booking- some services are free, after the while they cancel it and write you that you need to call customer service in Malaysia (even though I am based in UK) to pay for those by phone. Pure scam! I hope my flight exists at all as apparently their website is a scam."
1,They cancelled our selected seats &#8230;,"They cancelled our selected seats before the flight without informing us and although we selected seats together by the window we were assigned random seats as in Ryanair. They claimed that seats were not confirmed. Well, they were confirmed by us and we took a screenshot, but the airline did not accept this as a proof. It is 14 hours long flight and not the cheapest one. Horrible customer service, better to avoid. Never again!"
1,Terrible airline!,I have been waiting for my luggage for over two weeks. I get no info and every time I get to talk to anyone at Malaysian they promise alot and never get back to me or sorts out the problem. Terrible airline.<br /><br />Can&#39;t understand that they still are in business!
1,Not using Malaysia Airlines again!,"Not even sure where to begin. Ok, I have never booked through Kiwi before so it is safe to say that after my not so fortunate recent experience, I will not be using them again to book my flights.<br /><br />Our flight was from Singapore to Siem Reap via KL with Malaysia Airlines. Upon checking in we were advised that we needed to pay for our checked in luggage even though the e-ticket clearly states that we have 20kg allowed per person, and already paid extra when we booked our tickets online. The guy behind the check-in counter of Malaysia airlines said they have been a victim of Kiwi before. He did not explain very well what actually happened but was adamant we pay over $100 per bag and we had 7 bags and disregarded what was written on the e-ticket. I was not going to give up so I rang Kiwi who then asked to speak to the Malaysia Airlines manager. Not sure what the conversation was but nothing changed after that. I then continued to argue with Malaysia Airlines, citing our rights and refusing to pay for our luggage when we already paid for them in the first place. After a very long and tireless argument with Malaysia Airlines, I rang Kiwi once again who then spoke to the manager, this time the Malaysia Airlines manager refused to speak to Kiwi again but gave in eventually. Anyway, it was a palaver at 5am in the morning! To cut a very long story short, we ended up paying for one luggage as opposed to 7. Still not happy and I hope that Kiwi will sort this out!<br /><br />Clearly, Malaysia Airlines has issues with Kiwi.com that need to sort out so that us, the passengers do not have to suffer as a result of their disagreements!"
2,Filthy toilets- MA004 KL to London,"1).Virtually impossible to get through on the call centre without waiting 15-30 mins and then another 15 mins to go through the options and make a action. **n.b. This is because cannot manage booking easily or some actions at all online, so ended up without a window seat. It&#39;s an issue for me - I&#39;m a PPL and aviation geek. Sitting in crowded darkened room for 13hours isn&#39;t flying as far as I&#39;m concerned,<br /><br />2). A380s cost &#8364;430m (2017 price) apiece but surprised the filthy toilets and utterly mucky flaking seat. Unbelievable. Hope it&#39;s not indicative of the maintenance of more critical components?. How much does a replacement bog seat cost, anyway!!?<br /><br />Flag carrier MA is representative of KL and Malaysia in general:- grubby, dysfunctional, but friendly."
1,Never have I had that little leg-room &#8230;,"Never have I had that little leg-room as when I flew between KL and BKK. Just go LCC, Malaysia Airlines are not worth the price. <br />Additionally I have had some quite bad check-in experiences. Avoid."
1,Absolute rubbish,Absolute rubbish. The worst customer service . Kept me on the phone for 2 hours without sorting anything our
1,"APPALLING, NON-EXISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE","Appalling, non-existent Customer Service.<br />On a recent trip from New Zealand to London via Kuala Lumpur, the young lad behind me became ill and vomited all over me and my co-passenger. I was sat in bulk-head seating and since there was no under-seat storage available, my hand gel and antibacterial wipes were stored in the overhead luggage compartments.<br />The seatbelt sign was activated as we had commenced our decent into KL, so I pressed my call button to ask for assistance to clean-up. I might add, this wasn&#39;t just a little vomit, the lad had projectile vomited all over me, chunks in my hair, running down my face, all over my blouse, in my lap, down my arms - I was literally sitting in a pool of vomit. <br />The cabin crew were still milling around at this point but ignored my requests for assistance. Many other passengers were wretching at the stench but the cabin crew were obviously keen to not have to deal with a clean-up at the end of their shift and continued to ignore our calls for help.<br />Even after landing, the cabin crew continued to ignore us and I exited the aircraft still covered in a strangers vomt. No one offered any assistance and I was forced to continue on with my travel for the next 21 hours in disgusting clothing, covered in vomit.<br />No showers were offered, no damp cloths, nothing. The flight crew ignored me completely, even when exiting the aircraft and explaining they would need to completely remove the seating and window shades (yup, vomit running inside the window shades and all over the back of my seat and into the monitor, remote and magazine pocket), they simply shrugged their shoulders.<br />Worse still, my return flight from the UK to NZ had be in the same seat and now the monitor (stowed in the armrest in bulkhead seating) will not raise and lock into place. Again, I attempted to have this addressed for a 13.5 hour flight and was ignored. Spare seating was available but I was only offered a centre seat at the back of the aircraft which I couldn&#39;t accept due to a back condition which requires me to stand and walk frequently.<br />While I cannot blame Malaysian Airlines for a young lad vomiting on me, the care an attention of the flight crew after this event and also later flights was non existent.<br />Multiple attempts to contact Customer Service have had no response.<br />This has been the last time I will travel with Malaysian Airlines, disgusting.....simply disgusting. I pity the poor person sat in my seat after me as I can pretty much guarantee they didn&#39;t &#39;deep clean&#39; the area - the risk for cross-contamination was extreme and the stench was absolutely foul!"
1,Absolutely useless - AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Malaysia airlines cancelled my flight and put me on a different one two days later. This caused significant disruption to my plans and I lost out on two days of hotel and car hire costs at my destination, as well as having to cancel business plans.<br /><br />I received no compensation, no offer of upgrades, not even an apology. They expected me to spend two nights airside trapped in KL Airport. Their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. They took a week to respond to my email, and then sent generic information with no response to my specific questions. The people at the call centre are clueless and say they don&#39;t have the authority to do anything. Will never use this airline again."
1,Awful customer service,"Awful customer service. After repeated severe delays forced me to cancel a planned trip, the airline have refused to refund my ticket and are refusing to respond to my enquiries. <br /><br />Steer clear of this airline. They are very keen to take your money, but do not appear to be able to live up to their legal obligations"
1,Unreliable,"We had return flights booked with MA from London to Penang via KL. 4 flights in total each once delayed but the 1st flight from LHR to KL was delayed by 11 hours, no explanation as to why other then the inbound flight had been delayed. A further 3 hour delay on our return flight from KL to LHR and each leg to and from PEN was delayed by approx 1.5 hours it was such a joke, i would never book this airline again. Only booked ironically as journey time from London to Pen was shortest compared to other airlines I know better next time."
1,Disgusting,AWFUL AWFUL AIRLINE. TERRRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
1,Flight turned back after realised overloaded with fuel! 11 months for complaint response,Booked a flight (25th Feb KL to London) that flew for a couple of hours and had to return to KL after they found out that it had been overloaded with fuel! And rebooked on a different flight the next day. 11 months for a response to a complaint which was a template response. No compensation for lost pay or inconvenience. <br />The consistent shoddy customer response reviews are accurate. I won&#39;t be using them again.
1,No response,They NEVER respond to any complaint - in our case missed connections and lost baggage. They don&#39;t care
1,No reply on my multiple complaint emails,"Basically, I enjoy flying Malaysia Airlines but where it goes all wrong is where you try to submit a remark or complaint by either email or website. They even sent me a questionnaire asking me for extra comments and when I write that I&#39;m not happy with the fact that they ignore my previous emails and enquiries, they do not even reply to that. If this is Malaysia&#39;s pride and best airliner then I will choose another company if I can.<br />Oh, I can tick the box that Trustpilot will send this comment to MAS. Tick tick tick."
1,"Flight canceled , customer service very bad","Flight canceled 5 weeks prior to departure. Proposal for new tickets at the same price but with a stop 5 additional hours ( London ) , to go and return.<br />No compensation , no response from the commercial service and a call center disastrous ( call waiting line then cut ).<br />I strongly advise to book on this company !"
1,Absolutely no compassion!,"In their latest FB post Malaysia Airlines goes on about home and people/family. Yes the people and places we call home are very different and important to us all. However my pending trip home to New Zealand, originally booked with Malaysia Airlines who I have flown with many times, has become something of a nightmare. My sister has cancer and I was booked to fly home, UK to NZ, on Feb 17th. Since booking the flight doctors have told us that my sisters condition has become worse and she now only has a couple of weeks to live. We contacted Malaysia Airlines to have my ticket moved forward but even though the situation was explained to them they refused to re-booked the ticket without charging an additional and unreasonable fee. It was cheaper to cancel the flight completely and book with another airline! Malaysia Airlines&#39; lack of compassion has been absolutely shocking and blunt and is a true indication of their business culture. So MH don&#39;t give us all this rubbish about people and home. You clearly have no true sense of either! The manner in which this issue was dealt with was appalling!!! I will certainly never fly with again and I would suggest that anyone thinking of doing so consider how difficult it will be to deal with them should you find yourself in a situation where urgent travel changes need to be made. I would also suggest that you pay a little bit more and fly with an airline that is more customer focused such as Qantas or Air New Zealand."
1,It&#39;s a scam - worst customer service ever!,"We booked tickets from Phuket to Kuala Lumpur to match a flight to Da Nang. A 5 days beforew departure, we got an sms telling us the departure was moved one day earlier (not leaving any reason). I tried every way of contacting the airline, via resvns at malaysiaairlines.com, customer at malaysiaairlines.com, on Facebook and calling the contact center. (Do not call them, the call lasted 19 minutes, and then they just left me with an empty line). We are traveling with small children and spending a night at the airport is not an option. The woman at customer service told me she could do nothing and just stopped talking in the phone."
4,All round pretty good and above average,"Despite all their troubles &amp; woes I really feel for MAS. I have lived in Malaysia for a number of years and flown back to the UK many times and pretty much always found them to be above average. My last flight was business to LHR on A380 and apart from the dreadful lounge experience in KLIA the flight was great. Sometimes their ground staff at KLIA can be a bit underwhelming and not always know procedures. Even when I use them in economy, again can&#39;t complain too much, staff always friendly and helpful, and if they can see you are a passenger who maybe likes a few drinks they will accommodate beyond the norm &amp; keep you topped up!. Entertainment system is adequate but not ground breaking or class leading."
1,"Fraudulent, unpleasant and rude","Bought 4 tickets, one of us unable to travel, decided to keep seat as would rather have the space. Informed airline, On arrival told she was a no show and our seat re-sold. This is immoral, unethical and basically amounts to theft. Complained at the time, was spoken to rudely and laughed at. Made complaint to KL &quot;customer service centre&quot; no response. Business class half empty to add insult to injury. I will NEVER fly with this airline again. 3 of 4 flights boarded and left late. Only brightside is the cabin crew were good and pilots had good take offs and landings. I remain disgusted and very angry."
2,Impossible Call Center,5 months ago I bought tickets from London to Kota Kinabalu on Borneo. As my wifes passport was about to expire I ensured when I bought the tickets that it was possible to change afterwards.<br />When my wife got her new passport her name was changed (because her passport was from before our marriage). So I contacted Malaysia Airlines to change the name. I tried to convince them that it was still the same person flying - but I would be charged USD30 to change the name. After a lot of mails forth and back I accepted this payment - but after having called the call center twice to make the payment they still haven&#39;t changed the name - nor the passport number. They keep on saying that it will be changed within 2 hours - but nothing happens!?!<br />As I am a danish resident it is quite expensive to call Malaysia. I got an English number - but when I contacted the English office they charged me GBP75 - which is even more than I payed for the ticket (one way)!<br />Every time I contact them via mail - they don&#39;t investigate anything before replying...
